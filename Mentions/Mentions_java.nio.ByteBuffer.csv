93685,2,1,7,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You have to know what the encoding of the file is, and then decode the ByteBuffer into a CharBuffer using that encoding."
9628316,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I'd recommend only using this if you need to support converting between two character encodings, otherwise a ByteBuffer/Channel or byte[]/IOStream implementation would be preferable even if you're piping characters."

294720,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I think that CharBuffer and ByteBuffer (as well as any other xBuffer) were meant for reusability so you can buf.clear() them instead of going through reallocation every time If you don't reuse them, you're not using their full potential and it will add extra overhead."
294469,2,1,15,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In general, though, CharBuffer (and ByteBuffer) can really simplify APIs and encourage correct processing."
304059,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you are trying to transfer from one native stream to another, then you are better off using a ""direct"" ByteBuffer."

463527,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The direct byte buffers allow you to allocate a buffer of some size on either the C++ or Java side and then easily access the buffer from both languages; in Java this is done through methods on the ByteBuffer object and in C++ you can obtain a pointer to the data.
477977,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Maybe java.nio.ByteBuffer is what you are looking for.

579600,1,0,16,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I need to put the contents of a java.nio.ByteBuffer into an java.io.OutputStream.
579600,1,0,16,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I can't use the ByteBuffer's array() method since it can be a read-only buffer.
579600,1,0,16,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I also may be interspersing writes to the OutputStream between using this ByteBuffer and having a regular array of byte[] which I can with use OutputStream.write() directly.
579616,2,1,28,java.nio.ByteBuffer,With the WritableByteChannel adapter you can provide the ByteBuffer which will write it to the OutputStream.
607745,2,1,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer may use a byte[] (create from, say, ByteBuffer.wrap) or non-Java heap memory (created with ByteBuffer.allocateDirect)."
607745,2,1,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can get the underlying byte[] with ByteBuffer.array.
618481,2,1,18,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"But you could use java.nio.ByteBuffer, which is basically the class you suggest in work-around #2."
618481,2,1,18,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"As a standard library class, I'd also assume that ByteBuffer is more likely to receive special treatment wrt."

6167913,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The usecase I have is an object creation free XML parser and processor of the data contained using Unsafe compared with using a plain direct ByteBuffer.
6157164,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"sun.misc.Unsafe works under the authority of security managers, so it won't help Like Sarnum said:    ByteBuffer has package private   abstract _set and _get methods, so you   couldn't override it."
624506,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer is abstract so, yes, you can extend it... but I think what you want to do is extend the class that is actually instantiated which you likely cannot."
624506,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It could also be that the particular one that gets instantiated overrides that method to be more efficient than the one in ByteBuffer.
624508,2,0,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Assuming that your tests are correct (which microbenchmarks are often not): are you really sure that access to ByteBuffer is going to be the performance bottleneck in your actual application?
624508,2,0,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It's kinda irrelevant whether ByteBuffer.get() could be 4 times faster when your app only spends 5% of its time there and 95% processing the data it's fetched.
624508,2,0,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Edit: If, as stated in the comments, the app actually does spend 20-40% of its time in the ByteBuffer methods and the tests are correct, that means a speedup potential of 15-30% - significant, but IMO not worth starting to use JNI or messing with the API source."
624508,2,0,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Could the app be modified to make fewer calls to ByteBuffer rather than trying to speed up those it does make?
6167177,2,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You cant extend ByteBuffer and thanks God for.
6167177,2,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Well, having only 2 real subclasses ensures that the JVM can Heavily optimizes any code involving ByteBuffer."
6167177,2,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,edit: How to declare any class and bypass Java verifier On Unsafe: Unsafe has 2 methods that bypass the verifier and if you have a class that extends ByteBuffer you can just call any of them.

6196981,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,A Java Agent could modify ByteBuffer's bytecode and change the constructor's access modifier.
6196981,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Hopefully ByteBuffer is not needed by the JVM before your agent can hook into it.
846439,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,To my dismay the NIO ByteBuffer did not perform well.
846439,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I added a few tests:  ArrayTest_CustomBuffering (Read data directly into my own buffer) ArrayTest_CustomBuffering_StaticBuffer (Read Data into a static buffer that is created only once in the beginning) FileChannelArrayByteBuffer (use NIO ByteBuffer and wrapping your own byte[] array) FileChannelAllocateByteBuffer (use NIO ByteBuffer with .allocate) FileChannelAllocateByteBuffer_StaticBuffer (same as 4 but with a static buffer) FileChannelAllocateDirectByteBuffer (use NIO ByteBuffer with .allocateDirect) FileChannelAllocateDirectByteBuffer_StaticBuffer (same as 6 but with a static buffer)  Here are my results:, using Windows Vista and jdk1.6.0_13 on the extracted rt.jar: ArrayTest time  = 2075 bytes = 2120336424 ArrayTest time  = 2044 bytes = 2120336424 ArrayTest_CustomBuffering time  = 1903 bytes = 2120336424 ArrayTest_CustomBuffering_StaticBuffer time  = 1872 bytes = 2120336424 DataInputByteAtATime time  = 2668 bytes = 2120336424 DataInputReadFully time  = 2028 bytes = 2120336424 MemoryMapped time  = 2901 bytes = 2120336424 FileChannelArrayByteBuffer time  = 2371 bytes = 2120336424 FileChannelAllocateByteBuffer time  = 2356 bytes = 2120336424 FileChannelAllocateByteBuffer_StaticBuffer time  = 2668 bytes = 2120336424 FileChannelAllocateDirectByteBuffer time  = 2512 bytes = 2120336424 FileChannelAllocateDirectByteBuffer_StaticBuffer time  = 2590 bytes = 2120336424   My hacked version of TofuBear's code: code."

637468,2,0,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Finally, although it shouldn't make any difference, when you are wrapping the entire array in a ByteBuffer, you only need to supply the byte array itself."
655948,2,0,61,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you're dealing with character encodings other than UTF-16, you shouldn't be using java.lang.String or the char primitive -- you should only be using byte[] arrays or ByteBuffer objects."
28047560,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In addition to Adam Rosenfield's answer, I would like to add that ByteBuffer.array() returns the buffer's underlying byte array, which is not necessarily ""trimmed"" up to the last character."

660539,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Essentially, pull in slabs of bytes from your data, wrap a ByteBuffer around them, and then use the get(), getFloat(), getInt() etc methods."
664389,1,0,38,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It does not look like the ByteBuffer class is what I'm looking for.
19476769,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,There is the ByteBuffer class in Java.
19476769,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html It has bulk methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from a byte array to hardware buffers.

19557576,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,then you are saying that you are done with the ByteBuffer!
678069,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,What's the best way to implement a Java-like ByteBuffer in Obj-C?
678069,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I'm trying to build a application for the iPhone, although I am completely new to Obj-C. For one problem I'd use a ByteBuffer in Java, but I don't see any appropriate class in Apple's documentation."
678414,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,My recollection of java.nio.ByteBuffer (from working with Java many moons ago) is that ByteBuffer implements sequential reads/writes to an array of bytes.
18663753,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,My aim is to implement a fully functional Obj-C version of   java.nio.ByteBuffer.
679298,1,0,35,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Gets byte array from a ByteBuffer in java.
679298,1,0,35,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Is this the recommended way to get the bytes from the ByteBuffer code.
679325,2,0,46,java.nio.ByteBuffer,which is equivalent as per the ByteBuffer javadocs.
679335,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"This is a simple way to get a byte[], but part of the point of using a ByteBuffer is avoiding having to create a byte[]."
679335,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Perhaps you can get whatever you wanted to get from the byte[] directly from the ByteBuffer.
684735,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"(Just to a similar thing-- write two ints to an 8-byte ByteBuffer, then update the MessageDigest with the corresponding 8-byte array.)"
702367,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ParsedDataHandler is an interface that I am trying to design; I think I want to do something like this (""BlockInfo"" represents some data structure containing various bits of state that will include a ByteBuffer holding the entire block of raw data."
707351,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Should I call (non-blocking) receive(ByteBuffer) repeatedly until I get a null back to read all waiting datagrams?
707351,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"When sending in non-blocking mode, can I rely on send(ByteBuffer, SocketAddress) to either send the the whole buffer or rejecting it entirely, or do I need to possibly keep partially written buffers?"

715429,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,function chain: funcB() -> ByteBuffer.wrap() My question is how come funcB does not need to do a try-catch block around this java api method that throws an exception.
715429,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I believe the answer has to do with the fact that the java api method throws an exception BUT IS NOT DECLARED as ""throws IndexOutOfBoundsException"" function chain: funcA() -> funcB() -> ByteBuffer.wrap(...) My next question is when I DO change funcB to ""funcB() throws IndexOutOfBoundsException"" how come funcA doesn't need to catch funcB's thrown exception?"
715429,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Does the compiler dig deep and realize that ByteBuffer.wrap(...) isn't declared as ""wrap() throws IndexOutOfBoundsException"" so all callers don't actually need to catch anything even sub-callers (funcB in this case) actually are declared as ""funcB throws IndexOutOfBoundsException""?"
717194,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I wrote a serializer which writes to/from ByteBuffer which is about twice as fast and half the size of Hessian (about 5x faster/smaller than Java Serialization) This may be too much effort for little gain if existing serializations will do what you need.
720987,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Use a ByteBuffer and do comparisons between raw bytes as they are read.

10010046,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"After this, you need a to create a ByteBuffer where you will read from the FileChannel."
830214,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,About the best you could do is use ByteBuffer.allocateDirect.
838406,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,BTW: Accessing ByteBuffer.allocateDirect() with say getDouble()/putDouble() can be slower that just using a double[] as the former involves JNI calls and the latter can be optimised to no call at all.
831763,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer.asCharBuffer gives you a very literal two bytes to char (big or little endian) with updates reflected in both buffers.
831784,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer.asCharBuffer() assumes that the bytes are UTF-16.
833761,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You should probably look into using something like ByteBuffer from the java.nio package instead.
839230,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Does FileChannel#map allocate all the memory needed for the resulting ByteBuffer immediately, or is it only allocated on-demand during reads from the buffer?"
839519,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"For interoperability, look at the ByteBuffer class."
839519,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"For reading data written from C, then you generally wrap() a ByteBuffer around some byte array that you've read from a file."
839519,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In case it's helpful, I've written more on ByteBuffer."
841315,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"This won't help you with automatically padding/aligning your data, but it does make working with raw data held in a ByteBuffer much more convenient."
860190,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You can use a ByteBuffer.allocateDirect() which allocates memory in the ""C"" space rather than the heap and it is fixed in memory."
876308,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I think you're having an issue with the ByteBuffer on the allocation.
876308,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I would recommend doing some sysouts on ByteBuffer  code. }

1023200,1,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The problem that I'm having is that the ByteBuffer .array() method (which should return a byte[] array) doesn't work for read-only files.
1023200,1,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,But I don't want to wrap all of my buffers a ByteBuffer.wrap() function because I'm worried that this will slow things down.
1023200,1,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"So I've been writing two versions of everything, one that takes a byte[], the other that takes a ByteBuffer."
1023303,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Using the ByteBuffer.wrap() functionality does not impose a high burden.

1026800,2,0,80,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I'd like to thank dfa for pointing out the ByteBuffer.getLong method in the comments.
1026800,2,0,80,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"For example, if we had a 8 byte array, and we wanted to view it as two int values, we could wrap the byte[] array in an ByteBuffer, which is viewed as a IntBuffer and obtain the values by IntBuffer.get: code."
1033653,1,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Is it possible to read the Process stdout InputStream into an NIO ByteBuffer?
1033795,2,1,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Otherwise you might want the StreamConsumer to be a Callable<ByteBuffer>.
1044506,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I had to add this line after creating the ByteBuffer.
1045632,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,BufferedReader for large ByteBuffer?
1045632,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Is there a way to read a ByteBuffer with a BufferedReader without having to turn it into a String first?
1045632,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I want to read through a fairly large ByteBuffer as lines of text and for performance reasons I want to avoid writing it to the disk.
1045632,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Calling toString on the ByteBuffer doesn't work because the resulting String is too large (it throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space).

1047229,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I can think of two ways to handle it:  Allocate the ByteBuffer large enough to handle the complete data set needed to process a large 2D tiled map from my example.
1047229,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If the ByteBuffer is a smaller size (perhaps 1500), subsequent reads can be done and put out to a file until it can be processed completely from the file."
1047229,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I'm using a dedicated ByteBuffer for every SocketChannel so that I can keep reading in data until it's complete for processing.

1071844,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I would look for directly allocated ByteBuffer.

1115562,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can use ByteBuffer when reading the data and change the byte order with the order() method.
1099857,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I have found that java.nio.ByteBuffer is typically better for this sort of thing.
1099911,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer is good for byte-manipulation.
8054854,2,0,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"One way is to wrap the array in java.nio.ByteBuffer, use the absolute put/get functions, and slice the buffer to work on a subarray."
8054854,2,0,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer can be a bit tricky to understand, but is most likely efficiently implemented, and well worth learning."
1100640,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"As mentioned, NIO ByteBuffer allows you to wrap an array and then slice it, but gives an awkward interface."
1113136,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You can use a ByteBuffer/allocateDirect() This creates a byte buffer which is in the ""c"" space and doesn't use heap so it won't get moved and can be use efficiently with JNI calls."
1126536,2,1,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Look into using ByteBuffer.allocateDirect.
1126536,2,1,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Now, not only can JNI code discover the address of the native memory space inside of a buffer created with ByteBuffer.allocateDirect() on the Java side, but it can allocate its own memory (with malloc(), for example) and then call back to the JVM to wrap that memory space in a new ByteBuffer object (the JNI method to do this is NewDirectByteBuffer())."
1132218,2,1,7,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Multiple Possibilities:  byte[]  the most direct way  ByteBuffer  flexible has random access and bulk operations has operations for duplicating, slicing, etc preferable if IO/Network intensive (NIO)  InputStream  allows pipelining if done right has no support of random access or bulk operations."

1147873,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The problem is that the occasional issue with a large ByteBuffer and an overflowing underlying TCP buffer means that this call to send() will block for an unexpected amount of time.

1186473,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,One thing you might try is using a larger buffer for the ByteBuffer.
1193780,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,A typical approach would be to introduce a re-useable ByteBuffer.
1193780,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Once the buffer is populated you could then send the data over the wire using SocketChannel.write(ByteBuffer) (assuming you are using NIO).

1231654,2,1,23,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Direct ByteBuffers (those allocated using ByteBuffer.allocateDirect) are different to MappedByteBuffers in that they represent different sections of memory and are allocated differently.
1231654,2,1,23,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Therefore MappedByteBuffers won't register their use of memory in the same way a Direct ByteBuffer will.
1231654,2,1,23,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Direct ByteBuffers can be allocated from within JNI using NewDirectByteBuffer call from C/C++ (MappedByteBuffers likely use this) and this probably doesn't affect the reservedMemory value, which is may only changed when using the Java ByteBuffer.allocateDirect."

1775638,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,A better solution may be to reuse the same ByteBuffer so you never need to re-acllocate ByteBuffers.
11319807,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I also don't know if you can free a direct Buffer created by Java's ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(int)[8] for exactly the same reason as above.

1854406,2,1,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I suspect that somewhere your application has a reference to the ByteBuffer instance(s) and that is preventing it from being garbage collected.
1854406,2,1,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The buffer memory for a direct ByteBuffer is allocated outside of the normal heap (so that the GC doesn't move it!!).
1854406,2,1,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"However, the ByteBuffer API provides no method for explicitly disposing of / deallocating a buffer."
1854406,2,1,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,So I assume that the garbage collector will do it ... once it determines that the ByteBuffer object is no longer referenced.
1854414,2,0,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The ByteBuffer documentation says:  A direct byte buffer may be created by invoking the allocateDirect factory method of this class.

1936865,2,1,119,java.nio.ByteBuffer,In fact the private java.nio.Bits defines these helper methods that are used by ByteBuffer.putInt(): code.
1944995,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I then use a private ByteBuffer the size of a double to read from it  code.
1945064,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Instead of reading into a ByteBuffer, I would use file mapping, see: FileChannel.map()."
1980069,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You may want to recycle them if they are ""ByteBuffer"" rather then byte[]"
1997194,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Those give you a java.nio.ByteBuffer.
1998421,2,1,14,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Then, have a look at ByteBuffer.allocateDirect() which creates a ByteBuffer instance which memory can be shared with C.

1998421,2,1,14,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Pay attention to the fact that once the direct ByteBuffer that wraps the native memory has been created, you are still responsible for managing the native memory: at some point, you will have to call delete buf; in your native code, Java won't do it for you."
2035266,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,What would make this scheme sort of manageable from performance point is that for this purpose Java NIO has ByteBuffer which is a high level representation of low level byte mapping on disk.
2043339,1,0,7,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Each message can be constructed either from a Map, or from a ByteBuffer (the messages are binary, but we know how to transfer to and from a binary representation)."

2043477,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If what you want to do is getting a message and formatting it with specific values (like ""The table :tableName doesn't have a column named :colName"") you can convert the ByteBuffer to a Map and calling the first method."

14296775,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"As an alternative, you could always use some fairly simple C code to open and configure the framebuffer, and then use JNI to return the memory-mapped framebuffer as a direct-mode ByteBuffer, so you can draw to it directly."
14232446,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"And of course Java dev team creates a nice way to encode/decode chars: Charser#newDecoder returns you CharsetDecoder, which could be used to comvert ByteBuffer to CharBuffer according to a Charset."
2099020,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"you can store the data in a java.nio.ByteBuffer to avoid all the string wackiness... if it's truly text being sent in some wide character encoding, you'll want to convert the byte buffer into a string using the appropriate character set with the handy java.nio.charset.Charset.decode"
2152537,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"A very good class for extracting bits from a stream is java.nio.ByteBuffer, which can wrap arbitrary byte arrays; not just those coming from a I/O class in java.nio."
2152537,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Note also that if you cannot change the byte-order and it is not in network order, then java.nio.ByteBuffer can still serve you here with buf.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN); before retrieving the values."
2152103,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,EDIT : actually (as @Kevin Brock points out) java.nio.ByteBuffer allows you to specify the endian-ness when fetching various data types from a binary buffer.

4072339,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The problem with having a ByteBuffer directly emulate a datainput/output stream has to do with not knowing the sizes in advance.
4122075,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,What is the difference between ByteBuffer and CharBuffer in Java NIO?
4122075,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,What is difference between ByteBuffer and CharBuffer in case java.nio package.
4122094,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Mostly, yes - but ByteBuffers also have operations for viewing a ByteBuffer as other kinds of buffer (e.g."
4122095,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,A ByteBuffer is a buffer for (8-bit) byte values while a CharBuffer holds (16-bit) chars.
4131330,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I have a ByteBuffer object that contains a value that might be any number of bytes long, with the capacity of the buffer set to the length."
4131589,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Finally, unless you use ByteBuffer.remaining() instead of ByteBuffer.capacity() I suggest you use the absolute get method for long: ByteBuffer.getLong(0)."
4131359,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer has some special ""get"" methods, like getLong(int index): code."
4140432,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You shouldn't allocate your ByteBuffer once per read.
25283190,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,If you are trying to convert anything longer than a single character it will probably come as a byte[] and instead of converting that to a string and then using a for loop to append the characters of each byte you can use ByteBuffer and CharBuffer to do the lifting for you: code.
4267461,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Edit: My guess is that every time I call SocketChannel.write(ByteBuffer src), at least one individual packet will be sent, even the buffer has only 1 byte(assume Nagle is off), am I right?"
4299165,2,1,92,java.nio.ByteBuffer,There are multiple ways to do it:  Use a ByteBuffer (best option - concise and easy to read): code.
4299449,1,0,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,(2) Instruct the BufferedImage to use a java.nio.ByteBuffer to somehow directly access data in the char array returned by OpenCV.
4319696,2,1,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Managed to speed up the process using an NIO ByteBuffer.
4319696,2,1,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Using the java.nio.ByteBuffer, I can quickly address the char array returned by the OpenCV code without (apparently) doing much gruesome array copying."
4332264,1,0,17,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Wrapping a ByteBuffer with an InputStream.
4332264,1,0,17,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I would like to use this method with a ByteBuffer also.
4332264,1,0,17,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Is there a way to wrap a ByteBuffer so it can be accessed as a stream?
4332427,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If it's backed by a byte array, you can use a ByteArrayInputStream and get the byte array via ByteBuffer.array()."
4332427,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,This will throw an exception if you're trying it on a native ByteBuffer.
4337655,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can change the byte ordering of ByteBuffer by using the order method.
4341777,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer to bigdecimal, binary, string."
4359019,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I would use FileChannel from the nio package and ByteBuffer.
4398731,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"How should it be rewritten with ByteBuffer, for LITTLE_ENDIAN, as the following code doesn't work for me: code."
4398822,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer will work for you, if you use putInt and not put."
4432182,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"To store the byte-array as longs, I suggest you wrap the byte-array in a ByteBuffer and use the asLongBuffer method."
4443833,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can use ByteBuffer from java.nio.
29132118,2,0,7,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I tested the ByteBuffer method against plain bitwise operations but the latter is significantly faster.
4492749,2,0,16,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can use ByteBuffer for this: code.
17207799,2,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The reason why its wrong is that when we interpret a 2-byte array into integer, all the bytes are unsigned, so when translating, we should map the signed bytes to unsigned integer: ((myArray[0] & 0xff) << 8) + (myArray[1] & 0xff) the result is 36237, use a calculator or ByteBuffer to check if its correct(I have done it, and yes, it's correct)."
4507615,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,New ByteBuffer with Shifted Bytes (Java)?
4507615,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I have a ByteBuffer called buffer.
4507615,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"To illustrate, if this is my ByteBuffer (where P is the current position and the numbers 0-9 indicate byte positions): code."
4507615,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,... then I would want to form a new ByteBuffer that looks like this: code.
4513596,2,0,17,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You probably want to make use of java.nio.ByteBuffer.
4534583,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"What's causing ""Unable to retrieve native address from ByteBuffer object""?"
4534583,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Unfortunately, I'm using a library which have a method that accepts a ByteBuffer object and throws when I try to use it: code."
4534583,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"My code takes an existing packet, and extract a ByteBuffer out of it: code."
4534583,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Then it calls on of the dump methods of jNetPcap that takes a ByteBuffer.
4534798,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Many JNI calls expect a direct ByteBuffer.
4534798,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Even the standard libraries in Oracle Java 6.0 expect this and if you provide them with a heap ByteBuffer they copy your data to/from a direct one for you.
4534798,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In your case, you have a byte[] which can be copied to a direct ByteBuffer."
4534798,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,note: creating a direct ByteBuffer is expensive and you should cache/recycle them if you can.
4534595,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Based on the information you've provided it appears you are using a ByteBuffer implementation that doesn't allow the Native code to get access to the underlying memory structure.
4534595,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"It is attempting to access the direct memory in your ByteBuffer, which it probably shouldn't be doing, and is failing because the class deriving from ByteBuffer doesn't store data directly."
4534595,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If this is critical code you can't change, your best bet would be to create a ByteBuffer using the Java implementation, then copy the original data into your temporary buffer; Pass the new buffer to your native method."
4534595,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I am a little hesitant to use rewind() and limit() as I don't know what the implementation of your ByteBuffer will return so check to make sure it implements the interface of ByteBuffer correctly.
4534747,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"However, all is not lost: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html#allocateDirect(int) will do what you need."
4541793,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Java will move to the end of the file and append See http://download.java.net/jdk7/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SeekableByteChannel.html#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer)  or  http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/rafs.html for more info :)
4543048,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,One way to do this is to make use of NIO's ByteBuffer class: code.
4588103,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You could use a ByteBuffer.
4619787,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer.getShort() reads the next two bytes of the buffer, takes care of the Little-Endian ordering, converts the bytes to a short, and positions itself for the next getXXX() call."
4619325,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"While ByteBuffer is generally the best way to build up byte arrays, given the OP's goals I think the following will be more robust: code."
4619233,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,How about ByteBuffer ?
4619246,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Though using something like a ByteArrayOutputStream or a ByteBuffer like other people suggested is probably a cleaner approach and will be better for your in the long run :-)
4700055,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"... instead of using byte[] as the underlying data type for binary fields, we’ve switched to using ByteBuffer."
4700055,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Related changes in the source code: ""Switch binary field implementation from byte[] to ByteBuffer""."
6190124,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You may try using the ByteBuffer API.

4647337,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"File copy in Java - Benchmark  In general, a FileChannel with a 256K byte array which is read through a wrapped ByteBuffer and written directly from the byte array is the fastest way."
4649278,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"On the other hand, if you need to decode the bytes into some other charset, you'll have your work cut out, since CharBuffer is charset-agnostic, and  CharsetDecorder.decode(ByteBuffer) internally allocates a new CharBuffer roughly the same size as the input bytes."
4649278,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"But the basic approach would be to implement CharSequence and wrap the memory-mapped ByteBuffer, a smaller CharBuffer for  'working space', and a CharsetDecoder."
4649278,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You'll use Charset.decode(ByteBuffer,CharBuffer,boolean) to decode the bytes 'on demand', and hope that the general direction of the regex matcher is 'forward', and that the input you're interested in comes in fairly small chunks."
4651343,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"There is another solution which will not return the Java address as native pointer it's called direct java.nio.ByteBuffer, it has been designed with exactly that idea in mind."
4651343,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It allocated memory by direct ByteBuffer is not allocated in the java heap and it's not subject of standard garbage collection.
4651343,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Then, of course, ByteBuffer offers the direct pointer via  ByteBuffer.address()"
4662055,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you can code your own struct(ure) using ByteBuffer (which is probably not an easy task) you can go beyond the 32bit limitations by java.io.MappedByteBuffer, ScatteringByteChannel/GatheringByteChannel."
4674393,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It may be a better idea to pass a ByteBuffer to the native function and have pxs take a char * to be filled with data.
4682942,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Parse ByteBuffer looking for whitespace.
4682942,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I have a ByteBuffer containing some data (chars to be exact).
4682986,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The simplest way it to step threw the ByteBuffer until you get a whitespace.
4685271,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Handle byte[] with ByteBuffer.
4685271,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I try to access a byte[] via a ByteBuffer in order to represent a file-type I defined.
4685381,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you are adding chars to a ByteBuffer and expecting them to be readable with a CharBuffer view, you should be using putChar(...) not put(...)."
4685381,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"After loading all of the chars, your original ByteBuffer will be positioned to the next location."
4699014,2,1,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can wrap a byte array using ByteBuffer.wrap.
4702178,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,DataInputStream is not as efficient as using NIO/ByteBuffer but the effort increases for a relatively small improvement.
4708206,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I had to do some work similar to this a while back and I found that the best way to do this sort of work is to use ByteBuffer and its conversions to DoubleBuffer, LongBuffer, etc."
4708206,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can convert an array of bytes into a ByteBuffer by calling code.
4708213,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can use DataInputStream or ByteBuffer to read the various types.
4713299,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I suggest you try using ByteBuffer to store data.
4722743,1,0,13,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Is there a way to map the offsets in a CharBuffer to offsets in the matching ByteBuffer at all?
4728523,1,0,8,java.nio.ByteBuffer,One of them is a benchmarking between FileChannel + ByteBuffer + Mapping (FBM) and RAF.
4765228,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"This is the code I have tested with, but I probably doesn't use ByteBuffer correct."
4765278,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You have to reset the ByteBuffer using the flip() method after you insert the bytes into it (thereby allowing the getLong() calls to read from the start - offset 0): code.
4769217,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can use ByteBuffer.
4774176,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,you can set ByteBuffer's byteOrder to littleEndian and just use getInt
4791654,1,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"My code, something like:    ArrayList byteBuffers = new ArrayList();   byteBuffers.add( ImageHelper.loadImageAsIconImage(""stickmanicon32x32.png"") );   byteBuffers.add( ImageHelper.loadImageAsIconImage(""stickmanicon16x16.png"") );   System.out.println( ""taskbaricon result: "" + Display.setIcon(byteBuffers.toArray(new ByteBuffer[]{})) );  I tried adding a 40x40 image too, but no change."
4795337,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The bytes are being read from a ByteBuffer with the byteOrder being Little Endian.
4795883,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It looks like you have a ByteBuffer filled with your bytes already.
4795883,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Why don't you let the ByteBuffer reverse the bytes for you?
4804585,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer vs.
4804585,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I've read that ByteBuffer (java.nio) should be used over the Buffer class for reading in data simply because it's more efficient (?).
4804585,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Right now, I have a datagram packet whose byte array I wrap a ByteBuffer around and read from there."
6244753,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I think ByteBuffer is to be used just because Buffer does not have enough functionality to make access efficient from programmer's point of view, not from efficiency."
4805042,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"A DatagramSocket cannot read directly into a ByteBuffer, but you can do this using a DatagramChannel instead."
4827732,2,1,38,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can use a ByteBuffer.
4841340,1,0,67,java.nio.ByteBuffer,What is the use of ByteBuffer in Java?
4841340,1,0,67,java.nio.ByteBuffer,What are example applications for a ByteBuffer in Java?
4841590,2,0,47,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The ByteBuffer class is important because it forms a basis for the use of channels in Java.
4841590,2,0,47,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer class defines six categories of operations upon byte buffers:  Absolute and relative get and put methods that read and write single bytes; Relative bulk get methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from this buffer into an array; Relative bulk put methods that transfer contiguous sequences of bytes from a byte array or some other byte buffer into this buffer; Absolute and relative get and put methods that read and write values of other primitive types, translating them to and from sequences of bytes in a particular byte order; Methods for creating view buffers, which allow a byte buffer to be viewed as a buffer containing values of some other primitive type; and Methods for compacting, duplicating, and slicing a byte buffer."
26680496,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Here is a great article explaining ByteBuffer benefits.
26680496,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Following are the key points in the article:  First advantage of a ByteBuffer irrespective of whether it is direct or indirect is efficient random access of structured binary data (e.g., low-level IO as stated in one of the answers)."
26680496,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Following are benefits specifically for direct ByteBuffer/MappedByteBuffer.
19347910,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer is among several buffers provided by JAVA NIO.
4841345,1,0,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The only way I know that I can pass the data from the int arrays to C is to use ByteBuffer.allocateDirect to create a new buffer, copy the data to that and then make the C code act upon the buffer."
4841345,1,0,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"For example, a call to ByteBuffer.array() will fail on the newly created buffer."
4841345,1,0,10,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"For example, it would be nice if I could use IntBuffer.wrap(new int[...]) to create the buffer and then manipulate the array backing the buffer directly in Java but I cannot do this because the only thing that seems to work here for JNI is ByteBuffer.allocateDirect."
4846995,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Then, as ephemient states, you can use ByteBuffer.asIntBuffer() and family to access the buffer in a way that emulates arrays of the various Java primitives."
4845486,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Everytime the Graphics changes, I extract the R,G,B and A information as bytes for each pixel and write it to a ByteBuffer in the A R G B order."
4880196,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"for the Char-to-Byte-formatting, use CharsetEncoder/CharsetDecoder (transfers data between CharBuffer and ByteBuffer)."
4889854,2,1,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,An easy way to convert it to a stream is:  Allocate a ByteBuffer Populate it using putShort calls Wrap the resulting byte[] in a ByteArrayInputStream Create an AudioInputStream from the ByteArrayInputStream and format  Example: code.
4920182,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Another alternative: could you use a FileChannel and a ByteBuffer (java.nio)?
5673227,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You must store the result of the read in a variable, and test it for:  -1, indicating EOS, meaning you should close the channel zero, meaning there was no data to read, meaning you should return to the select() loop, and a positive value, meaning you have read that many bytes, which you should then extract and remove from the ByteBuffer (get()/compact()) before continuing."
4932112,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you want to use a ByteBuffer and CharBuffer, don't do the simple .asCharBuffer(), which simply does an UTF-16 (LE or BE, depending on your system - you can set the byte-order with the order method) conversion (since the Java Strings and thus your char[] internally uses this encoding)."
16312616,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Aside: java.nio classes and java.io Reader/Writer classes use ByteBuffer & CharBuffer (which use byte[] and char[] as backing arrays).
4937752,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"java, ByteBuffer to parse data from file."
4937752,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I've been reading about ByteBuffer and memory mapped files.
4944886,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I would suggest using a ByteBuffer and then using code such as this to get what you want.
4950692,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If the latter, I would suggest using ByteBuffer."
4957973,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Basically I would like to know whether there is a performance difference in casting or is it better to use bigger ByteBuffer.
4958008,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Basically I would like to know whether there is a performance difference in casting or is it better to use bigger ByteBuffer.
4984256,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Otherwise for the SUN impl and IPv4, you can play dirty:  ipaddress.hashCode() - not recommended but it does work Otherwise (recommended): int  ipv4 = ByteBuffer.wrap(addr.getAddress()).order(ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN).getInt()"
5012160,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You could use FileChannel to create a ByteBuffer.
5040629,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I know I can create a Document from a byte array through the use of a ByteBuffer.
5078100,1,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"There has to be a more efficient way of using the ByteBuffer to read that file into the array, but I'm not seeing it at the moment."
10034604,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Consider dropping the BufferedInputStream, allocating a larger ByteBuffer yourself and obtaining a little-endian IntBuffer view on the data."
10034604,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Then in a loop reset the buffer positions to 0, use DataInputStream.readFully to read the large regions at once into the ByteBuffer, and pull int values out of the IntBuffer."
14654441,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Use AudioRecord.read(short[], int, int) or AudioRecord.read(byte[], int, int)  instead of AudioRecord.read(java.nio.ByteBuffer, int);"
5095928,2,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Similarly, a ByteBuffer can wrap a File but also simply an array of bytes in memory."
5158187,1,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I tried a direct ByteBuffer so I could use its array() method to get direct access to the underlying buffer.
5158187,1,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The ByteBuffer does not expand dynamically.
5158294,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You can also use ByteBuffer, the position() will tell you how much data was read."
5158294,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Direct buffer doesn't support array() however, you would have to read from the ByteBuffer using its other methods."
26423654,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The class ByteBuffer  provides methods for putting all primitive data types, in little endian or big endian byte order, as you wish."
5188501,1,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Java Circular Byte Buffer that Extends java.nio.ByteBuffer.
5188501,1,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Every Java circular byte buffer implementation I have seen referenced on SO and elsewhere does not extend java.nio.ByteBuffer, which for me is necessary for use with a SocketChannel."
5188501,1,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Does anyone know of an open source implementation that extends ByteBuffer.
5192233,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You cannot extend java.nio.ByteBuffer, simple as that."
5191057,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Create a buffer which is 100 * N bytes are only compact() the ByteBuffer when there is less than N bytes left.
5191057,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Another optimisation is to compact() the ByteBuffer whenever there is no remaining data as this is very fast.
21438152,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I would leverage the method ByteBuffer.wrap().
21438152,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Looking quickly at the implementation by Cisco that Mr. Dean Hiller posted earlier, you could replace the put() by a getWriteBuffer() which would return you a ByteBuffer that wraps the portion within the buffer it can write."
21438152,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It would have the advantage of not having to compact which could be costly depending on the amount of bytes there is in the ByteBuffer at the cost of complexifying the parsing logic: you may get the first part of your message for the ByteBuffer that wraps the last region of the underlying circular buffer.
21438152,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"To get the second part of your message, another read is needed to get the byte array at the beginning of the circular buffer wrapped into another ByteBuffer."
5194325,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"From what I found out so far, I need to pass the texture as a ByteBuffer to openGL."
5194325,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The thing is, I have no clue how to get from a BufferedImage to a ByteBuffer that contains data in the right format for use with openGL (as input for the function GL11.glTexImage2D())."
5201422,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"As outlined below, you can use ByteBuffer to interpret a value as either a big- or little-endian quantity."
5210954,2,0,12,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer is part of the new IO package (nio) that was developed for fast throughput of file-based data.
5210954,2,0,12,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"When you want very fast file-to-network throughput, then you want to use memory mapped files and ByteBuffer."
5210954,2,0,12,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"ByteBuffer works best when you are just dealing with bytes as plain byte data -- once you need to convert them to objects, the other java io classes typically perform better and are easier to use."
5210954,2,0,12,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you're not dealing with memory mapped files, then you don't really need to bother with ByteBuffer -- you'd normally use arrays of byte."
5210954,2,0,12,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you're trying to build a web server, with the fastest possible throughput of file-based raw byte data, then ByteBuffer (specifically MappedByteBuffer) is your best friend."
8603622,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The most useful java classes I've found are: java.util.Scanner, java.util.Formatter and java.nio.ByteBuffer."
5220644,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Use ByteBuffer from java.nio.ByteBuffer: code.
5238301,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I am reading from database a large collections of this type List<Rows<Long,String,ByteBuffer>> I then read the data from these list of rows one by one and put the data from them into container objects."
5244952,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Some friend advises me to use the class ByteBuffer, ByteOrder but i don't know how to use them since I don't know how many bytes are really read when the server is reading the file."
5268274,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Then you align the address on the page and apply an offset to ByteBuffer access.
5268171,2,0,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Use ByteBuffer.allocateDirect().
5280296,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,What I truly want is a ByteBuffer based array of C alike Struct but fully usable in java.
5304671,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Why alternative, here I address your main concerns:     You need to know the maximum bytebuffer size in advance of serializing an object    Why max size of ByteBuffer?"
5345601,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,See http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html especially the order method which lets you specify endianness and the getInt method which lets you read an int.
5345601,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,To read a file using a ByteBuffer do something like: code.
5353811,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,HashSet of ByteBuffer(actually integers) to separate unique & non unique elements from a ByteBuffer array.
5353811,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Thus I am using HashSet of this type: HashSet<ByteBuffer> columnsSet = new HashSet<ByteBuffer>() Just wanted to know if HashSet is a good way to do so?
5353811,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"And do I pay more costs, when doing so for a ByteBuffer then if I would have done it for a Integer?"
5354072,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Creating a ByteBuffer is far more expensive than reading/writing from a reused ByteBuffer.
5354083,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Looking at ByteBuffer and Integer one can see that the implementation of those methods in Integer are simpler (just one int comparison for equals() and return value; for hashCode()).
5354083,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Thus you could say the Set<ByteBuffer> has higher cost than a Set<Integer>.
5357805,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Assuming your lightBuffer is a ByteBuffer (it seems no other class has a method asFloatBuffer), your FloatBuffer object is only a wrapper around the same underlying byte[] or native memory."
5357805,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"This FloatBuffer object does not eat any more memory (but uses the same memory the lightBuffer uses), but it could hinder the garbage collection of the ByteBuffer - but it seems you are reusing this one, don't you?"
5370841,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"NIO, itself, features ByteBuffer, however that should not impose any effects on the external/stream model you represent your data."
27072296,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I like owlstead's original answer, and if you don't like the idea of creating a ByteBuffer on every method call then you can reuse the ByteBuffer by calling it's .clear() and .flip() methods: code."
11419863,2,0,17,java.nio.ByteBuffer,This method uses the Java ByteBuffer and ByteOrder functionality in the java.nio package.
5419874,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In Java, this could be done by reading the standard input/outputstreams, using Sockets (or anything based on this, like RMI), or using a shared file (Try mapping the file into memory as a ByteBuffer from both processes - though it seems to be system-dependent whether other processes see the changes)."
5416711,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"EDIT: (It's a Java program, didn't notice that first) Java's ByteBuffer asCharBuffer interprets the data in the buffer as wide character string (i.e. two bytes per character), while OpenGL will return you a one byte per character string."
5465538,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I only need to use the ByteBuffer parameter in the override code.
5472638,2,1,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,[*] The task of an encoding is to convert some given binary data (usually from a byte[]/ByteBuffer/InputStream) to textual data (usually into char[]/CharBuffer/Writer) or the other way around.

20604909,2,0,11,java.nio.ByteBuffer,As the answer also alluded to using passwords it might be worth blanking out the array that backs the ByteBuffer (accessed via the array() function): code.
15825271,2,0,7,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Another possibility is using java.nio.ByteBuffer.
25569682,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you prefer ByteBuffer like @kalefranz, there is always the posibility to concatenate two byte[] (or even more) in one line, like this: code."
5549074,2,1,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,BTW: I have function which reads doubles from a direct ByteBuffer which takes 80 ns.
5598227,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"And more important, if you have any endianness issues this is probably the reason I was originally going to recommend using a ByteBuffer to extract values, but on a second look I think you should wrap your input stream with a DataInputStream."
5624144,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"However, you can use it to read a byte[] that contains your entire record, then use a ByteBuffer to retrieve individual values from that array."
5620307,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Maybe you can simply use a byte[] array to store this structured data, and use java.nio.ByteBuffer to wrap and manipulate it."
5626003,2,0,40,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I also suggest you try ByteBuffer.
5638561,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You'll probably want to write your own ObjectOutputStream implementation that constructs a ByteBuffer and write()s it to the channel.
5670862,1,0,60,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer.allocate() vs. ByteBuffer.allocateDirect().
5671880,2,1,64,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you pass a nondirect   ByteBuffer object to a channel for   write, the channel may implicitly do   the following on each call:  Create a temporary direct ByteBuffer   object."

5832399,2,1,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In particular, the factory method map(FileChannel, FileChannel.MapMode) will memory-map an entire file into an array of ByteBuffer and expose the array as a ByteBufferInputStream."
5689808,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,In Java you can use ByteBuffer.order() to handle bigendian numbers.
5702161,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Alternatively, if I choose non-blocking IO and use a selector to query for when clients have written to the server, how can I get read a String of unknown/unlimited length without using a set-size ByteBuffer?"
5712201,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In java, you can do this by setting the byte order on the buffer with ByteBuffer#order(ByteOrder) See this question also."
5719007,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Thus, I am using ByteBuffer(s) for read and write operations."
5719007,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I don't want to send the ByteBuffer, because I have a pool of them that I reuse, thus this is not an option."
5719007,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I want to be able also to even maybe combine several reads and send the content of several ByteBuffer(s) combined at once.
5719480,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The closest thing in the JDK is to use ByteBuffer.compact() which allows you to shuffle along data in a buffer.
5719480,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I would only use a ByteBuffer if your data format is simple, i.e. not full XML standard."
5720800,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"To deal with this   problem, we cannot use any of the   standard I/O utilities, but instead   must wrap our message in  a ByteBuffer   object and send it through the   SocketChannel object  Is that code not working in your case?"
5738681,2,1,11,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you create a CharsetDecoder for UTF-8, you can feed it only byte at a time (in a ByteBuffer) via this method."
5751231,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The class ByteBuffer has a method asIntBuffer(), where you can get an IntBuffer view of the ByteBuffer."
5751231,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The initial ByteBuffer is available by using file channels.
14507190,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,To avoid the memory churn you can use Charset.newDecoder to get a decoder(keep and reuse) and write the ByteBuffer you get off the wire directly into a reusable CharBuffer.
5827052,2,1,24,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Another approach is to use a ByteBuffer that wraps a 4-byte array.
5836705,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Look at ByteBuffer.asCharBuffer().
5836707,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It's unfortunate that there's no String(CharSequence) or String(ByteBuffer) constructor.
5837739,2,0,59,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"For serialization of objects that do not implement the Serializable interface you either need to write your own serializer, for example using the read*/write* methods of java.io.DataOutputStream and the get*/put* methods of java.nio.ByteBuffer perhaps together with reflection, or pull in a third party dependency."

5862759,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I know I can read an arbitrary number of bytes into a ByteBuffer, but a Websockets frame may have been sent with the handshake and I don't want to be passing off half-consumed buffers between these sections of code."
5862759,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Or maybe some combination of manipulating mark, limit and position would allow the input stream to get back data it had previously read into the ByteBuffer provided the buffer was allocated directly."
5863316,1,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Is Java native memory faster (I think this entails ByteBuffer objects?)
5864736,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I believe that the Terracotta folks used native memory via a ByteBuffer as it's an easy way to get out from under the Java garbage collector.
5863386,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Is Java native memory faster (I think this entails ByteBuffer objects?)
27072361,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Building on Jeff's answer, you can use a single ByteBuffer to convert both to and from int and byte[]."
5865859,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Then use the java.nio.ByteBuffer instead where you may specify the byte order() and write the data.

5936688,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,However if you have a heap ByteBuffer you can do.
6244779,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If code that is using data as characters does not strictly need a CharBuffer or char[], just do simple on-the-fly conversion; use ByteBuffer.get() (relative or absolute), convert to char (note: as pointed out, you MUST unfortunately explicitly mask things; otherwise values 128-255 will be sign-extended to incorrect values, 0xFF80 - 0xFFFF; not needed for 7-bit ASCII), and use that."
5952211,2,1,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,As this post points aus http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2008/11/c-binarywriter-is-little-endian-because.html C# BinaryWriter supports only little endian so you have to configure it on the java site with the order method http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html#order%28java.nio.ByteOrder%29
5952227,2,0,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"For example on java side, you can set it to use ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN (default is BIG_ENDIAN ) In your case you can use ByteBuffer.order() to set the order."
5966933,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"you could read into a 16K/32K byte array that is wrapped in a ByteBuffer for the purpose of pulling out the floats, or whatever you need for your data; if you actually have a performance problem with this approach, try to identify, not second-guess, what that performance problem actually is."
6000755,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You also have, in Java, the option of using ByteByffer: http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/ByteBuffer.html ... which has the ""order"" method to allow you to specify a byte order for operations reading multi-byte primitive types."
6001138,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"However NIO, ByteBuffer allows you to specify BigEndian, LittleEndian or NativeEndian (whatever the system uses by default) x86 systems tend to use little endian and so many Microsoft/Linux applications use little endian by default but can support big-endian."
6027537,2,0,14,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In which case I would use DataOutputStream.writeFloat(float) If you are using NIO, you can use ByteBuffer.putFloat()  An advantage of ByteBuffer is that you can specify a ByteOrder with ByteBuffer.order() so you can handle either Big or Little endian."
6083422,2,1,9,java.nio.ByteBuffer,This is similar to what you can do with ByteBuffer.
6065556,1,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I have a concern that the ByteBuffer created with allocateDirect might have a potential to overflow or not be allocated if the File infile is large, say 1GB."

6080785,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you want to play with the ByteOrder, the simplest thing to do may be to use ByteBuffer which allows you to set a byte order."
6080785,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If your file is less than 2 GB, you can map the entire file into memory and access the ByteBuffer randomly."
6077492,2,1,17,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The only facility in standard Java I know of that allows configuration of endianness is ByteBuffer via the order() method but then you open the gate to NIO and I don't have a lot of experience with that.
6108450,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,It uses a ByteBuffer.
6112127,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you don't want to use DataInput, you can read the bytes into byte arrays (byte[]) and use a ByteBuffer to turn those byte values into ints and longs with left padding."
6112127,2,0,2,java.nio.ByteBuffer,See ByteBuffer#getInt() and ByteBuffer#getLong().
6136659,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Your problem is that ByteBuffer.array() returns a direct reference to the array used as backing store for the ByteBuffer and not a copy of the backing array's valid range.
6136659,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,The reason for the extra 0 values in the backing array is a slight flaw in how the resulting ByteBuffer is created by the CharsetEncoder.
6136659,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Obeying this fixed value, the CharsetEncoder initially allocates a ByteBuffer with ""string length * average bytes per character"" bytes, in this case e.g."
6136659,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The UCS2 CharsetEncoder starts however with a BOM (byte order mark), which also occupies 2 bytes, so that only 9 of the 10 characters fit in the allocated ByteBuffer."
6136659,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The CharsetEncoder detects the overflow and allocates a new ByteBuffer with a length of 2*n+1 (n being the original length of the ByteBuffer), in this case 2*20+1 = 41 bytes."
6352962,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Run System.gc() before   ByteBuffer.allocateDirect()...

6181123,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you mean ""direct"" ByteBuffers, there's a put method which accepts other ByteBuffer instances so you can copy around."
6184437,2,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"You can just use put() with either a byte[] or a ByteBuffer, this will use a native call memcpy under neither in the Sun/Oracle JDK."

6220334,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I wouldn't create the String, but create the ByteBuffer with the text you would place in the String."
6220334,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Using a ByteBuffer instead will save you two copies.
6220334,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can place the message body in the ByteBuffer with enough padding at the start to put in the header later.

6631127,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can just combine the four bytes into an int instead of using a temporary ByteBuffer.
6637522,2,1,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can allocate a direct FloatBuffer by creating a ByteBuffer with allocateDirect and then getting a FloatBuffer view of it with asFloatBuffer.
6651455,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you can assume all characters are bytes, the whole issue is much simpler and you don't need a CharBuffer, you can access the ByteBuffer directly which would be much faster."

15366299,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The main issue is that while the system Arrays functions allows bulk copying and filling of array contents, it doesn't provide a utility to do so into an offset on the destination array; however, the Buffers from the NIO package allow you to do that quite easily, so if a solution exists, it's in the NIO ByteBuffer or it's kin."

16819377,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In your example it makes no difference, but if you used ByteBuffer.allocateDirect you could write faster."
16819377,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer API says A byte buffer is either direct or non-direct.
16831057,2,1,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"CharsetEncoder.encode makes no guarantees about the underlying array size, nor that the ByteBuffer will actually be backed by an array."
16849182,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,ByteBuffer.allocate within Constructors.
16849182,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,In my code I have a class with a ByteBuffer and two Constructors.
16849182,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Depending on the constructor, I want to allocate a different about of space to the ByteBuffer."
16849182,1,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,I only declared the ByteBuffer outside the constructors because I thought this is the only way the instantiated object would be able to access it (not sure if that is right though?)
16849341,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Assign ByteBuffer to Byte[] Error.
16849341,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"However, when I try and copy the ByteBuffer in the object to the byte[], I get an error."

16869856,1,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"In my main class, I create an instance of this class called ""data_packet"" and store the contents of the ByteBuffer ""data"" into a byte[]."
16869891,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"flip is used to flip the ByteBuffer from ""reading"" (putting) to ""writing"" (getting): after a sequence of put are used to fill the ByteBuffer, flip will set the limit of the buffer to the current position and reset the position to zero."
16869891,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"After finishing the put, you might want to reuse the ByteBuffer to construct another data structure."

16879078,1,0,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"So I was wondering, is there anyway to determine how many characters were written to the ByteBuffer and not just the total size of it?"
16879108,2,1,6,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"After you've written to the ByteBuffer, the number of bytes you've written can be found with the position() method."

16892630,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"(Marko linked it in his comment) What Marko referred to was having actually a ByteBuffer and fetching a ""DoubleBuffer""-View to it."
16892630,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,So you can put the Doubles into the DoubleBuffer View and fetch the byte[] from the original ByteBuffer.
16908099,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"As I mentioned in the comments, you're using a ByteBuffer with a size that is an odd number of bytes, but writing out two bytes at a time."

28231912,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Third, is to use ByteBuffer.allocateDirect."
28231912,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"The final, possibly best, and certainly most unpleasant option is to allocate and deallocate memory natively using JNI calls, and use it in Java by wrapping it in a ByteBuffer."
17065537,2,1,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"If you effectively have many identical arrays, use an HashSet<ByteBuffer> as a cache."
17065537,2,1,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,You can get the ByteBuffer array with method array() and the ByteBuffer class has hashCode and equals methods.
17065537,2,1,5,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"EDIT2 The comment from @Will is exact, to be able to get back the array, use a WeakHashMap<ByteBuffer,WeakReference<ByteBuffer>> and do something like that :  code."
17115274,2,1,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Or go the full way to java.nio and use a FileChannel and map your file in memory (and have a look at what ByteBuffer has to offer -- for instance you have a .asCharBuffer() to read chars and you can alter endianness as well)

17223354,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"This adds a fair bit of overhead to loading and saving, and may be annoying since you have to work through a ByteBuffer rather than a byte[]."
17223137,1,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"There are many responses, but they always boil down to either (1) use ByteBuffer or (2) do the conversion manually."
17223137,1,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I don't have a lot of experience with ByteBuffer, but I that was the first path I went down."
17223137,1,0,4,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"What I discovered is that if I have a ByteBuffer and I call its asShortBuffer() function, the resulting ShortBuffer has no backing array..."
17223205,2,1,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Why not just use the various get/put methods on the ByteBuffer to read/write short, int, and other values from/to the underlying byte array?"
17223231,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"I don't really know your usecase, but the question does not imply that you actually need to convert the whole byte array to an array of shorts / ints / longs (otherwise, the ByteBuffer or manuall conversion would be OK)."
17255359,2,1,3,java.nio.ByteBuffer,put(ByteBuffer) should be the fastest way to copy bytes between buffers.
17260937,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Note that it uses little-endian encoding so you could first wrap the structure in a ByteBuffer setting the order to little-endian.
17260937,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,Trick is to get the bytes in the bigEndianByteArray in the correct order after reading them from the ByteBuffer.

31439409,2,0,0,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Notice (aside from the encoding issue) that some of the more complicated code linked goes to the trouble of getting the ""active"" portion of the ByteBuffer in question (for example by using position and limit), rather than simply encoding all of the bytes in the entire backing array (as many of the examples in these answers do)."
30856252,2,0,1,java.nio.ByteBuffer,"Just wanted to point out, it's not safe to assume ByteBuffer.array() will always work."
