608524,2,0,6,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB is great if you have to code to some external XML spec defined as an XML schema (xsd).
608524,2,0,6,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Then you can just write a simple adapter layer to convert your trade objects to UltraTrades and use the JAXB to marshal the data across to Ultra-Corp. Much easier than messing about converting your trades into their XML format.

736415,2,1,49,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Tutorial 1 Tutorial 2 Note: JAXB also enables you to easily 'unmarshal' XML data (which was previously marshalled from Java object instances) back to object instances.
736415,2,1,49,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"One more great thing about JAXB is: It is supported by other Java-related technologies, such as JAX-RS (a Java RESTful API, which is availible as part of Java EE 6)."

780926,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"For JAXB, see Adding Behaviours."
780926,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Basically, you configure JAXB to return a custom instance of the object you'd normally expect."
780926,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,In the below example you create a new object PersonEx which extends the JAXB object Person.
780926,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"This mechanism works well in that you're deriving from the generated classes, and not altering the JAXB classes or schemas at all."
780926,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Note that the @Override directive is important in case your JAXB object changes - it will prevent your customisation becoming orphaned.
789456,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,One problem you may encounter is if you use JAXB 2.1.
790118,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB Types problem.

817840,2,1,6,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB then uses the JAXBElement class to work around this: a JAXBElement wraps a simple object that contains the data and assigns it a QName.
817840,2,1,6,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Thus you can read from this list and write to the list unambiguously by providing:  The data object (in your case a String since all restrictions from String are represented as a Java String) A JAXBElement whose getValue() method returns the string  The JAXB specification contains fairly detailed and reasonably complex explanations of how to deal with repeating choices and repeating sequences.

792661,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"After some further research it turns out that JAXB has built in support for RelaxNG, both XML and compact style."
6667121,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I found that creating classes direct from a RelaxNG schema using JAXB didnt give very readable classes, but if I used http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html to convert RelaxNG to XSD and then generated classes from XSD using JAXB the results were very good."
794354,1,0,19,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,:-( We are using Sun's JAXB implementation in the JDK 1.5 and the org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2.maven-jaxb2-plugin for the code generation from XSDs.
1782120,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,In our case updating the JAXB libraries was a good idea.
1782120,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Incidentially, using the server VM instead of the client VM even in the development environment was a good idea here, even though it normally slows down server startup: since the JAXB initialization takes so much time the better compilation of the server VM helps."
1782150,2,1,28,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,The JAXB reference implementation has a sort-of-undocumented system property for exactly this reason: code.
1782150,2,1,28,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,This instructs JAXB to skip the expensive process of pre-caching the various reflection muscles it needs to do the job.
1782150,2,1,28,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"However, one part of the speed problem is unavoidable, and that's the fact that JAXB has to load every single one of your classes, and classloading is slow."
799201,2,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"JAXB team is very good, responsive, and if you can show where problems are they usually come up with good solutions."
805989,1,0,16,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Can one validate marshalled XML with JAXB 2.0?
805989,1,0,16,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Apparently in version 2 of JAXB - the validator class has been deprecated - does this mean the marshaller is automatically validating your XML?

2172942,2,1,146,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"To tie together what others have already stated or hinted at, the rules by which JAXB XJC decides whether or not to put the @XmlRootElement annotation on a generated class are non trivial (see this article)."
2172942,2,1,146,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"@XmlRootElement exists because the JAXB runtime requires certain information in order to marshal/unmarshal a given object, specifically the XML element name and namespace."
2172942,2,1,146,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"The annotation is just a convenience, however - JAXB does not require it."
2172942,2,1,146,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"This is partly there for backwards compatibility with JAXB v1, but it's also there as a place for XJC to put generated factory methods which create JAXBElement wrappers around your own objects."

3706450,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I think there is no pretty print for Unmarshaller because the result of the JAXB unmarshaller is not an XML but a Java object.
3706450,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I hope the future versions of JAXB will have a solution to this shortcoming, since it is important for logging, etc."
15473025,2,0,8,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"On the other hand, if all you want to do is reformat the XML, you probably should be using JAXP instead of JAXB."

1177943,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Uncommenting 1 and 4 is the correct way to set JAXB up with Groovy.
1177943,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB is trying to expose this as a JAXB property which obviously fails.
1177943,2,1,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Since you don't declare the metaClass property yourself, it is not possible to annotate it to have JAXB ignore it."

1638528,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,So in my current project I use the JAXB RI with the default Java parser from Sun's JRE (which I believe is Xerces) to unmarshal arbitrary XML.
1638528,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,That is to say if I'm passed XML that conforms to this schema then JAXB correctly unmarshals it into an object tree.
1638528,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"So my ultimate question is: When unmarshalling with JAXB, should the loading of remote entities by the underlying SAX parser be automatically short circuited when the XML in question can be recognized as invalid without the loading of those remote entities?"
1638528,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Given that JAX-WS relies on JAXB under the hood, it seems like I could pass specially crafted XML to any JAX-WS based web service and cause the WS host to load any arbitrary URL."

1752073,2,1,5,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"JAXB knows this, and so doesn't bother adding the namespace to AddFixedPriceItemRequest - it's just not necessary."
1752073,2,1,5,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If this is indeed the case (which is hard to believe, but possible), then using a Java XML document model like JAXB is going to be a struggle, since that will assume XML is XML is XML."
1752073,2,1,5,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"My approach would be to marshal the JAXB model to a DOM object (using a DOMResult passed to the Marshaller), and then see if you can do some manual tweaking of the DOM to force the xmlns into the document at the appropriate places."
1752073,2,1,5,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"edit: here's another suggestion, a bit less awful than the JAXB-to-DOM-to-XML solution."

17402537,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB is pretty easy to understand and operate.
17402537,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,what it requires is couple of annotations like @XmlRootElement and @XmlAccessorType along with four lines of code Modifying XML files in Java is much easier using JAXB as compared to other XML parsers like DOM and SAX because you only deal with POJOs JAXB is more memory efficient than DOM or SAX parser.
17402537,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB doesn't require XML schema to work.
17402537,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Though you can use XML Schema for generating corresponding Java classes and its pretty useful if you have large and complex XML Schema which will result in huge number of classes but for simple usage you can just annotate your object with relevant XML annotations provided by JAXB package i.e. java.xml.binding and you are good to go.

5423528,2,1,8,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Alternate Approach The following code should work with any JAXB implementation without requiring any code changes to your model.
5429389,1,0,22,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I used CXF with the default JAXB binding and imposed different generated packages for each services.
5429389,1,0,22,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I am not bound to CXF or JAXB other than the time required to re-factor the system towards a different framework or data bindings.
5429389,1,0,22,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,This points to a feature of JAXB that would be useful : episodes.
6406137,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If you want to trim down a little, an alternative marshalling technology (in any framework) might do the trick - drop JAXB and try JiBX, which was added to the latest CXF release, or maybe just StAX."
6406137,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Since you're looking to do something a little more custom than the conventional JAX-Ws/JAXB style services, you may want to consider Spring-WS."
6406137,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"It can route messages in different ways (payload, XPath expressions, etc), and you can use any marshalling/serialization technology you want (Jibx, jDOM, SAX, etc) Here is a table that illustrates the options: http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/2.0/reference/html/server.html#d4e1062 If you really want to get fancy, you can take one of the lower level APIs, start marshalling the message and once you hit critical mass for one of your common areas, start a JAXB marshall right on the spot."
6406137,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"The key thing Spring-WS will buy you here is to break out of the JAX-WS mold, do play a little up front game, and then you can always marshall back to JAXB later, whether it be in interceptors, your app, etc."
6406137,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"In theor you can the same with JAXB DOM Source, but it's my opinion that the Spring-WS stack gives you the finest grained control for special situations like you have here."
5435138,1,0,36,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB and property ordering.
5435138,1,0,36,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,It seems that JAXB orders alphabetically.
5435336,2,0,17,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Note:  I lead EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy) The order in which Java reflection returns the list of fields/properties is not guaranteed.
5435336,2,0,17,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,This is why JAXB implementations do not use it to determine element order.
5435336,2,0,17,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,By default JAXB provides no guaranteed ordering.
5435336,2,0,17,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,However most (if not all JAXB impls) use alphabetical ordering since it is deterministic.
5451958,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,in jaxb for Example (a bad one) I could have created @XmlAlwaysRequiredElement Is there a good reason why JAXB annotations like XmlElement are not using the same technique?
5451991,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"You example concerns data validation, and JAXB is designed to work with XML Schema to do that, rather than doing to validation using annotations."
5451991,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If we want to have annotation-based validation for JAXB, then it would make more sense to use JSR-303 validations for this, and have the JAXB runtime pick them up and use them, rather than, or in addition to, XML Schema validation."
5458581,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,If this is a questin regarding XML to java mapping then JAXB can handle it: code.
5458833,1,0,62,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Use JAXB to create Object from XML String.

5459644,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,If the property should be List<FormerUser> then you will need a way to tell JAXB what the ID corresponds to.
5459644,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If the data for FormerUsers will occur in the document then you can use @XmlID and @XmlIDREF for this mapping:  http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/10/jaxb-and-shared-references-xmlid-and.html  If the data for FormerUsers will occur outside the document, then you can use the strategy I described in the answer below:  Using JAXB to cross reference XmlIDs from two XML files"
5459659,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"These beans have both JPA and JAXB annotations, and are being used in a RESTful implementation."
5459659,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Using JAXB annotations, you declare an element (field or property) to be transient, but the eclipselink-oxm.xml only allows transient declarations on types."
5463732,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Below are a couple of approaches: Standard JAXB The following will work with any JAXB implementation (Metro, MOXy, JaxMe, etc)."
5463732,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy) If you happen to be using EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy), then you can use the @XmlPath extension (I'm the MOXy tech lead)."

5477842,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB to use Woodstox parser for performance?
5477842,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,The existing code uses JAXB for marshalling and unmarshalling java objects which are generated via CXF (wsdl to java).
5478101,2,1,8,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If your JAXB implementation uses a StAX parser under the covers via the standard JAXP APIs, then adding the Woodstox jar to your classpath should cause your JAXB impl to use Woodstox."
5478101,2,1,8,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Since the Woodstox jar contains the following entries, adding it to the classpath will allow the JAXP APIs to return an instance of it:  META-INF/services/javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory META-INF/services/javax.xml.stream.XMLOuputFactory  Note: I lead EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy), and MOXy uses a StAX parser when one is available."
5478101,2,1,8,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"The other JAXB implementations (Metro, JaxMe) probably do the same thing."
5491864,2,1,5,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Of course, this payload can be xml (and bound via JAXB)."

22102718,2,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"which is probably similar to user3243752's answer, I bet that JAXB is automatically choosing the ClassLoader from the passed in class when using the #newInstance(Class... classesToBeBound) method signature."
6116573,2,0,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"In my case I was able to resolve this by adding a file called ""jaxb.index"" in the same package folder as the JAXB annotated class."
6116573,2,0,14,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"For example, my file /MyProject/src/main/java/com/example/services/types/jaxb.index is simply one line (since I have only one JAXB typed class): code."
6017501,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I know that you can force JAXB to validate this by adding a schema to an Unmarshaller.
6017501,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Since JAX-WS uses JAXB internally I hope that there is a possibility to turn that on for web services as well.
6021106,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,You could use @XmlAnyElement(lax=true) and the @XmlPath extension in EclipseLink JAXB (MOXy) to handle this use case (Note:  I'm the MOXy lead).

6030989,2,1,7,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Basically you need to make sure all the classes which are supposed to be serialized are known to JAXB.
6030989,2,1,7,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"as a property type of one of classes which  are already known to JAXB), then JAXB has no chance to know how to serialize instances of B."
6030989,2,1,7,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,The intention of @XmlSeeAlso annotation is to make sure JAXB looks into these listed classes too.

6049887,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB was included as part of the JDK with the release of Java 6.
6049887,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,This code generation method will create Java Objects that include JAXB-specific annotations that are used by the Marshaller to map the Java object to its XML format and vice versa.
6049887,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Now, as I mentioned, this technique does generate JAXB annotated classes, however, the generated code may still be compatible with XStream as I believe XStream uses simple attribute name -> xml node name conversion logic."

7901646,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Below is example of where a single model is leveraged to create a RESTful web service:  http://blog.bdoughan.com/2010/08/creating-restful-web-service-part-35.html  Since EclipseLink provides both JAXB and JPA implementations we provide a number of extensions to make this easier:  http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/MOXy/JPA http://blog.bdoughan.com/2010/07/jpa-entities-to-xml-bidirectional.html   UPDATE In response to:  Agree to what you are saying.
7901646,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Then use JPA and JAXB to solve the impedance mismatches between object-relational and object-XML.
7901646,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,One Model Approach Using one model for both JPA and JAXB means that when you make a change to the model you need to decide at that time how it will be handled for both JPA and JAXB (this can be good or bad).
7901646,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,If you don't want every new addition to the model to affect the JAXB mapping you can leverage JAXB concepts like @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE).
7910150,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Java and XML has matured and the consensus is JAXP and JAXB together with the streaming API, with one exception:  If you want Xpath 2.0, Saxon is probably the choice; it also has bindings to the beforementioned libraries (at least for Xpath 1.0)"
7909376,1,0,6,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB default attribute value.
7909376,1,0,6,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I'm using JAXB annotations to generate xsd schema from my classes.
7909451,2,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Might wanna check this: Does JAXB support default schema values?
7909451,2,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"To be honest, I don't have a clue why there isn't an attribute default option in standard JAXB."
7929910,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If your POJOs are mapped to XML via JAXB metadata, then you could wrap the root object in an instance of javax.xml.bind.util.JAXBSource and use the javax.xml.xpath APIs to issue XPath queries against it."
7932534,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,The default List implementation in JAXB 2 is java.util.ArrayList.
7925620,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Take a look at JAXB Reference Implementation Project and Model Development Tools (MDT).
7930492,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Then JAXB should use a Double instead of a double.
7929765,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If you cannot modify the XML schema to make the value element nillable, then you could do the following with a JAXB external bindings file: External Bindings File (binding.xml) You could use an external bindings file like the following: code."
7927755,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I am trying to enforce some single assignment semantics and the number of parameters to my class is too large to put in a single constructor and I need to be able to make these classes JAXB aware as well, so the objects need to be mutable but I want to enforce single assignment semantics."
7928148,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,You can configure JAXB to use field (instance variable) access using @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD).
7928148,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,This will allow you to do what you need to with the set method:  http://blog.bdoughan.com/2011/06/using-jaxbs-xmlaccessortype-to.html  You can also use JAXB's XmlAdapter mechanism to support immutable objects:  http://blog.bdoughan.com/2010/12/jaxb-and-immutable-objects.html
7927934,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,That way the builder can be JAXB-aware.

14104100,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,When JAXB encounters an anyType element it will bind it to a property of type Object.
7930687,2,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"That means that JAXB must detect, during marshalling, what kind of object we're dealing with."
7930687,2,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Since String - which is what you actually put into the hello field - has a direct binding to a schema type (namely xs:string) JAXB is gonna go with that.
7930687,2,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,But JAXB is trying to generate XML that'll be useful for unmarshalling as well.
7930687,2,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Since the schema didn't specify a type and the hello field is an Object, trying to unmarshal from XML would leave JAXB guessing as to what it should actually turn the content into."

7964750,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,If I'm not mistaken JAXB and JDOM and completely different things.
7964750,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB will serialize java objects into an XML format and vice versa.
7964750,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Using JAXB in this way is like trying to at runtime add a new variable to a class.

7987330,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,So I was able to get the whole thing working using the JAXB reference implementation.
7987330,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,The trick was to realise that the download from JAXB site is a downloader and not the actual libraries!
7987330,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,The only problem I had was that I had an xsd with a root tag called <product> that anonymous extended the Product type to add a version attribute (which I always like to have on my root tag's) which was causing a name conflict for JAXB.
7987330,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"So instead, I turned the anonymous type into a named type (i.e. TopLevelProduct) and set the root to that type and JAXB was happy with that."

8406266,1,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I'm just starting to learn to use JAXB to marshal my java objects into XML.
8406463,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,You could use JAXB with StAX to do this.
8408882,2,0,5,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,You could do this with JAXB (an implementation is included in Java SE 6).
8510634,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I think that is better achieved with JAXB.
8420184,2,1,20,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Well, the key is the JAXB @XmlRootElement and a custom XmlAdapter :-) First you need to write your own wrapper for the map."

8431608,1,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Could someone please share their experience of some scenarios where Spring does not provide enough flexibility and scenarios where JAXB would be much much better off to use.
8431673,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB and Spring feel like chalk and cheese to me.
8431673,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB takes an XML stream and generates Java Beans from it.

8431788,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If it is the question of loading config and starting your app (and only this requirement) then you can go with JAXB, but if there are requirements where you need to configure your app to interact with other services or make your app use DI (in the future) then spring is the way to go."
8431788,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,you can use both JAXB and spring togather but (if you use jaxb to load config as java objects) spring can be used to setup java objects with values using xml.

8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Below is my initial answer based on:  http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xml-c14n-20010315#Terminology  1 -  The document is encoded in UTF-8  By default JAXB marshals to the UTF-8 encoding.
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"2 -  Line breaks normalized to #xA on input, before parsing  JAXB doesn't retain line breaks so this doesn't really apply."
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"3 - Attribute values are normalized, as if by a validating processor  You can specify an XmlSchema on the Unmarshaller to have a JAXB implementation use a validation processor:  http://blog.bdoughan.com/2010/12/jaxb-and-marshalunmarshal-schema.html   4- Character and parsed entity references are replaced  Most JAXB implementations delegate this work to the underlying parser used."
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"5- CDATA sections are replaced with their character content  The standard JAXB APIs do not allow you to marshal to a CDATA section, so you are ok here."
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,6 - The XML declaration and document type declaration (DTD) are removed  JAXB does not write out a DTD declaration.
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,7 - Empty elements are converted to start-end tag pairs  JAXB does not write out empty elements as start-end tag pairs.
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,8 - Whitespace outside of the document element and within start and end tags is normalized 9 - All whitespace in character content is retained (excluding characters removed during line feed normalization)  JAXB implementations retain all whitespace in character content (between start/element tags).
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,10 - Attribute value delimiters are set to quotation marks (double quotes)  The reference and MOXy JAXB implementation use double quotes for attribute value delimiters.
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"11 - Special characters in attribute values and character content are replaced by character references  JAXB will replace & with &amp;, < with &lt;, and "" with &quot;  12 - Superfluous namespace declarations are removed from each element  JAXB implementations do their best not to write extra namespace declarations, but can not guarantee that extra namespaces are not declared."
8434530,2,1,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,13 - Default attributes are added to each element  TBD  14 - Lexicographic order is imposed on the namespace declarations and attributes of each element  JAXB implementations do not guarantee on ordering of the namespace declarations and attributes of each element.

17782854,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,It is possible to load JAXB implementation from a specific library using the Java Endorsed Standards Override Mechanism.
17782854,2,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,This is also suggested in the guide Using JAXB 2.1/2.2 with JavaSE 6.

10002848,2,0,8,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,To specify a JAXB (JSR-222) implementation other than the default you need to include a file called jaxb.properties in the same package as your domain classes.
10002848,2,0,8,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,The following is an example of the jaxb.properties file used to specify the MOXy implementation of JAXB: code.

10029935,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Just define JAXB @XmlElement annotation with preferred name over required field setter.
10029976,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,At the end the service will automatically marshal with the help of JAXB and send the .XML back to the client.
10029976,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,My problems are the following:  I get a ClassCastException because the entity in the that is in the EJB module is not compatible with the JAXB class in the WebModule(Even if their variables are the same) I don't know how things should be organized so the front end can marshal and unmarshal those entities.
10029976,1,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Should maybe the entity class be in the front end combined with the JAXB mapping?

26762195,1,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Xml is taken care by JAXB and Json is implemented using Jackson api.
26765305,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Note: I'm using JAXB for this and I have created the Model Class for Contents, for Content and for SpecialCharacter where in Contents I have as members ArrayList<Content> and ArrayList<SpecialCharacter> but in this case I can't linked the lists correct to keep the correct order of tags."
26767158,1,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,But the problem is I want to use Jackson 2.x now because of better deserialization control and I cannot find any good documentation indicating how to configure jackson 2.x to ignore JAXB annotations Any help would be appreciated.
26767158,1,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"UPDATE: I tried objectMapper.configure(MapperFeature.USE_ANNOTATIONS, false); but this seems to have no effect on jackson picking up JAXB annotations."

26787511,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Here's my JAXB mapped object: code.
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I'd approach this with a combination of JTidy and either JAXB or XStream.
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB or XStream could then be used to unmarshal XHTML into Java objects and marshal them back in XML Form.
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I am, so to speak, more familiar with JAXB so I'll sketch the JAXB way."
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"With JAXB, you'd take the some XML Schema of XHTML, for instance XHTML 1.0 Strict Schema and compile it using JAXB's schema compiler, the XJC."
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB is a very good tool for strongly-structured schemas.
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,These asre things which sometimes look ugly in JAXB schema-derived classes.
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"So JAXB may be somewhat suboptimal for the task  Finally, a small advertisement block."
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"This project compiles some of the W3C Schemas with JAXB (for instance, XLink or XML Schema itself)."
26829142,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"However, if the OP opts to use JAXB, the module and code I refer to match the question very well."
26797524,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I have many classes generated by JAXB's xsd2java.
26798895,2,0,4,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Some Resource  Marshaller API doc has some examples Unmarshaller API doc has some examples JAXContext API doc has some explanation about the context General JAXB tutorial

26807170,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Well, you probably can override JAXB's instantiation mechanism somehow to reuse an existing instance (your singleton) instead of creating a new instance."
26807170,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Singleton per se is often an anti-pattern, but marrying it with JAXB unmarshalling would take the potential ""anti-"" even further."
26838996,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I'm not sure, what would work with GWT best, but here's a couple of ""usual suspects"" when it comes to JSON processing on the server side:  Jackson GSON   Since your data comes in XML and there's probably an XML Schema for it, then definitely do check Jackson/JAXB combo."

26855216,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"So for example, if I am trying to do rootObject.getAccount().getAccountName() but the Account element is missing altogether from the XML, I get a NullPointerException  I would like to configure JAXB to unmarshal the full object tree to include those representing missing elements."
26859983,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"My point is, it would be incorrect for JAXB to fill in these missing properties, but you can do this and the Fluent API plugin is the closes I would know to an easy-to-use API for this case."

26871941,2,1,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"If you use EclipseLink MOXy as your JAXB provider, then you can use our @XmlPath extension to get rid of that extra element."
26883102,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,JAXB discovers properties in a object by looking for properties that follow JavaBeans convention and public fields.
26883102,2,1,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,If JAXB discovers a clash (e.g.
26878345,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"In the service you return List in two methods, so Task object has to be JAXB compatible or in other words, at least a Java Bean."
26876190,1,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I'm using JAXB 2.2.11 and Java 7.
26882254,1,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I have added the module javax.xml.bind.api which contains all the JAXB stuff that the frameworks need and I have installed a new module javax.validation.api2 which basically contains version 1.1 (needed by the frameworks) instead of the provided-by-default version 1.0.

26891508,1,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I can't figure out how it manages to put all the Field2 objects into a List with just @XmlElement( name = ""field"" ), it must be JAXB that's doing that conversion, but I can't find how to override it and put into map."
26897622,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I would recommend to decouple your business layer from the web layer creating new JAXB annotatted entities to return from your REST controller.

26905995,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Using custom ObjectFactory with JAXB: is there an established ""go to"" pattern?"
26905995,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I understand that the ObjectFactory is often automatically generated when working with JAXB as one might define schema and XML first.
26905995,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I have existing code which needs to be annotated and extended to use JAXB to then use it in conjunction with a REST service.
26905995,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"As far as I understood the documentation (I am new to JAXB), I need an implementation of ObjectFactory either by package for automatic invocation on package level, or a multitude of implementations when they are referred to directly rather than referred to by package context."
26905995,1,0,3,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I would like to ask you not only for your experience with the technology and recommendation (which would be to opinion based) but also whether this approach will introduce any risks that I am missing as well as technical limitations regarding JAXB that I might run into if I pursue my course of action.
26906371,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"The JAXB implementation doesn't do package scanning, so it needs to find something in that package from which it can derive the rest of the model."
26906371,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,This does not need to be the whole list as JAXB will pull in referenced classes.
26906371,2,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"In that example an extension in the MOXy JAXB impl is used to provide the metadata, but you can create that JAXBContext anyway you want to."
27092826,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I recommend using JAXB or a similar binding framework that works with text based files.

32005164,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I'd like to create two separate JAXB packages from the same XSD where one of the package's implementation classes are mutable and the other's are immutable.
32005164,1,0,2,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"Writing a XJC plugin which causes generated classes to implement a required interface is easily done (as is hiding the enum classes which are redundant for the immutable package), however, I'm quite stuck in trying change the JAXB model by removing existing fields and adding them with other types."
32007662,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Have a look at JAXB.
32007662,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"As suggested by others, don't do this manually and instead use an existing library like JAXB."
32007662,2,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,An easy to understand JAXB hello world example can be found here.
32008657,1,0,0,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,I am trying to convert the google xml/atom feeds into collection of object(i.e. POJOs).But I read some documentation of JAXB and Xstream.But these have simple XML documents as compared to this :  code.
32009974,1,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I tried to parse it with StaX (i count START_ELEMENT and END_ELEMENT events to determine if I recieved the whole element), build string and then send it to JAXB to map it."
32009974,1,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,"I realised that, it is not a good way, because it doubles parsing (StaX and then JAXB)."
32009974,1,0,1,javax.xml.bind.JAXB,Anyway I have to specify a class to wchich JAXB have to map recieved XML element.
