119086,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,I don't know if this is a complete solution ... but you can determine if a table is a system table by reading the table_type column of the ResultSet returned by getTables: code.
139085,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,That means you have to check the Connection/Statement/ResultSet's SQLWarnings  code.
135008,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Take a look at the java.sql.PreparedStatement class, specifically the function http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/PreparedStatement.html#setBinaryStream(int,%20java.io.InputStream) Then take a look at the java.sql.ResultSet class, specifically the function http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/ResultSet.html#getBinaryStream(int) Keep in mind that if you are serializing an object into a database, and then you change the object in your code in a new version, the deserialization process can easily fail because your object's signature changed."

15919915,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,"Well, if you have a ResultSet of type ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY you want to keep it that way (and not to switch to a ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE or ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE in order to be able to use .last())."
192104,2,1,146,java.sql.ResultSet,"ResultSet.last() followed by ResultSet.getRow() will give you the row count, but it may not be a good idea as it can mean reading the entire table over the network and throwing away the data."
13598630,2,0,6,java.sql.ResultSet,"it's due to by default it is ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY, which means you can only use rs.next(); the solution is: code."
16885165,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,I checked the runtime value of the ResultSet interface and found out it was pretty much a ResultSetImpl all the time.
16885165,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,This code sample should suffice: ResultSet resultSet = executeQuery(sqlQuery); double rowCount = ((ResultSetImpl)resultSet).getUpdateCount() I realize that downcasting is generally an unsafe procedure but this method hasn't yet failed me.

212457,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Is there any way to lock the rows in the ResultSet ?
212569,1,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,I'd like to use JdbcTemplate (or SimpleJdbcTemplate) to execute a query and obtain the result as an instance of ResultSet.
212569,1,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"The reason I want to obtain the results as a ResultSet, rather than a collection of beans, is because the results will be passed straight to a Jasper report for display."
212569,1,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"In other words, the Java bean would be used for nothing other than temporarily storing each row in the ResultSet, and I'd like to avoid creating such a bean for every Jasper report if possible."
7911154,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,You can either invoke Jasper inside a JdbcTemplate callback (like a ResultSetExtractor) or use straight JDBC to pass the ResultSet to Jasper.
217317,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"So, it's good practice to unload your ResultSet objects into other objects to hold the values and drop the ResultSet objects themselves as soon as possible."

254990,2,0,7,java.sql.ResultSet,The statement should be closed AFTER the ResultSet has been used.
254990,2,0,7,java.sql.ResultSet,The spec says that you should get an SQLException if you try to use that ResultSet (some JDBC drivers don't follow the spec strictly--and MS is not biggest offender).
254990,2,0,7,java.sql.ResultSet,"If you forget to close a ResultSet or Statement, the worse case that happens is you consume database and JVM resources for longer than necessary."

325415,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,The second approach is to limit memory usage and increase performance so that the ResultSet you get from the JDBC driver will not include all data.
325415,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,You can limit the number of rows hold by the ResultSet using Statement.setFetchSize().
325415,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,If you move the cursor in the ResultSet beyond the number of rows fetched the JDBC driver will fetch the missing data from the database.
321418,1,0,23,java.sql.ResultSet,"The above does not compile, because both PreparedStatement.close() and ResultSet.close() throw a java.sql.SQLException."
682046,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,"Also note: ""When a Statement object is closed, its current ResultSet object, if one exists, is also closed. """
682046,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,"If you want to be really particular though, close the ResultSet FIRST, not after closing the PreparedStatement (closing it after, like some of the examples here, should actually guarantee an exception, since it is already closed)."

321454,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,Note that your current solution won't close the ResultSet if closing the PreparedStatement  fails - it's better to use nested finally blocks.

26766088,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,It is better to re execute query because when we call if(rs.next()){....} first row of ResultSet will be executed and after it inside while(rs.next()){....} we'll get result from next line.
13845772,2,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,Best to use ResultSet.next() along with the do {...} while() syntax for this.
13845772,2,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"The ""check for any results"" call ResultSet.next() moves the cursor to the first row, so use the do {...} while() syntax to process that row while continuing to process remaining rows returned by the loop."

984091,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,I think what you would want to do is defer the actually loading of the ResultSet itself.
984152,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,If you only fetch 1 row at a time each row shouldn't be loaded until you called next() on the ResultSet.
985197,2,1,26,java.sql.ResultSet,"If auto-commit is turned on, then the ResultSet will fetch all the rows at once, but if it's off, then you can use setFetchSize() as expected."
985010,1,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"For example, in order to find out the table names, you have to call getTables and loop through the returned ResultSet, using well-known literals as the column names."

2185039,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,I'm looping through a ResultSet in Java; which for testing purposes is returning about 30 rows with 17 Columns (all String data) per row.
2185039,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"Note: I realize this isn't the best way to go about getting XML out of a Database, or even the best way to get XML out of a ResultSet - but this has me curious of the slow performance regardless."
2186055,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,The problem is that the ResultSet has a persistent link to the database and gets more info when its called.
2186055,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,It will pull down all the data immediately and acts exactly like a ResultSet otherwise.
2185080,2,0,6,java.sql.ResultSet,"UPDATE From your last update, the StringBuilder is out of concern, and the problem is with the ResultSet."

2238159,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Unfortunately, now my problem has cascaded to some annoying proprietary code we have that limits the rows from the now expected ResultSet to displaying only 1 record anyway."
2238202,2,1,3,java.sql.ResultSet,double-check the complete constructed query and compare that it is actually what you expect double-check that you actually call setString() with different values for the index and the String and that you're not using the same value over and over again double-check that you're not calling next() on your ResultSet more than once per loop iteration.

2333904,2,1,5,java.sql.ResultSet,I recommend reading back data from your ResultSet on a thread other than Swing's Event Dispatch thread; Otherwise your UI will lock up during large read operations.
2335445,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,Another blatent plug for votes :) The link provided above by Adamski also contains my two suggestions for populating a JTable from a ResultSet.
2341322,2,0,32,java.sql.ResultSet,"Images are binary data and are to be obtained as either a byte[] or InputStream from the DB, the JDBC API offers the ResultSet#getBytes() and ResultSet#getBinaryStream() for this, and JPA API offers @Lob for this."

2363863,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,The following procedures should be done (in order)  The ResultSet The PreparedStatement The Connection.
2369669,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,So you can simply compare the string got by ResultSet.getString() with any other string or pass any string as parameter if using PreparedStatement.setString().
2382532,1,0,67,java.sql.ResultSet,"It opens a connection, builds a PreparedStatement using the sql statement and the parameters in the queryParams variable length array, runs it, caches the ResultSet (in a CachedRowSetImpl), closes the connection, and returns the cached result set."

4349433,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,It looks like the problem is that you are using a Scrollable ResultSet and that is going to use more memory.
4364533,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,Perhaps you should close the ResultSet as well as Statement.
4379592,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,How can I sort ResultSet in java?
4380170,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,It looks like you would have to be responsible for implementing the ResultSet interface with a custom object that would give you the functionality you're looking for....sorry.
4379609,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,Move the data out of the ResultSet into whatever object representation you want and then sort the data just as you would any other data at that point.
4395528,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"ResultSet executeQuery(String sql)                          throws SQLException Executes the given SQL   statement, which returns a single   ResultSet object."

4395438,2,0,6,java.sql.ResultSet,So the answer is a ResultSet with no rows.
4395438,2,0,6,java.sql.ResultSet,You can tell that the ResultSet is empty if next() returns false the first time you call it.
4398383,2,1,5,java.sql.ResultSet,JDBC will create a cursor for you as necessary; lost loop over the rows in the ResultSet.
4398463,2,0,6,java.sql.ResultSet,DbUtils.close(ResultSet); DbUtils.close(Statement); DbUtils.close(Connection);  The APIDocs shows all available methods.
4410115,1,0,6,java.sql.ResultSet,I'm creating an interface QueryHandler which has a method that takes a string (representing a query) and returns ResultSet.
4411043,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Instead of returning a ResultSet, consider returning a List or allowing the client to supply a Stream that your data access component can write to."
4425026,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Also, the documentation for ResultSet says   A ResultSet cursor is initially   positioned before the first row; the   first call to the method next makes   the first row the current row; the   second call makes the second row the   current row, and so on."
4425026,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"giving me the idea I could just next() through the whole ResultSet, but if I do first() and then next() it appears to work just fine."

16871785,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"But when you manually iterate the cursor you end the ResultSet on the first call to mapRow, that's why arg1 isn't incremented."

4483903,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"As for ResultSet and CallableStatement (or any Statement, for that matter), those can ultimately return one or more ResultSets to return query results."
4553974,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,The advantage of configuring the driver so that it works behind the scenes is that the programmer does not need to pass the type map into ResultSet.getObject(...) and therefore has one less detail to remember (most of the time).
4553974,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"In the behind the scenes approach the ResultSet.getObject(int) method will use the type mappings defined on the connection rather than those passed by the application code in ResultSet.getObject(int index, Map mapping)."

For example, if for some reason you are using a ""primitive"" type of database pooling and you call connection.close(), the connection will be returned to the pool and the ResultSet/Statement will never be closed and then you will run into many different new problems!"
4507507,2,0,13,java.sql.ResultSet,Here my point of view : You should close ResultSet and Statement explicitly because Oracle has problems previously with keeping the cursors open even after closing the connection.
4507507,2,0,13,java.sql.ResultSet,If you don't close the ResultSet (cursor) it will throw  an error like Maximum open cursors exceeded.

4508172,1,0,7,java.sql.ResultSet,"I kept the example short, thus just the cleaning up of the ResultSet."
4508480,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"If you are going to be doing this frequently, instead of copying and pasting this code over and over again, create a utility class with static methods to close the ResultSet, Statement and Connection."
4508544,2,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"For example, some drivers will not automatically close a ResultSet when it's associated Statement is closed."
4508544,2,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"Therefore, you have to ensure that you explicitly close both the ResultSet and its Statement (sigh)."
4508544,2,0,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"This technique guarantees that every close() statement is executed, starting with the ResultSet and working its way outward."

4541255,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,One caveat:  Consider using generics to make it return the correct subinterface of ResultSet: code.
4541255,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Note: Creating a new class that implements ResultSet may sound like a good idea on the surface, but quickly degenerates into madness due to ResultSet already having its own subinterface RowSet, which in turn has its own subinterface JdbcRowSet, which in turn has its own subinterfaces... and at the very end of this tree are the actual objects that are part of the JDBC driver for your database."
4541258,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"What I'm aiming to is to discourage you to implement a class that implements/wraps a ResultSet , except for very specific (low level) situations.In general it's bad practice to pass a ResultSet to bussiness layers; in the typical case, the JDBC driver instantiates the ResultSet, the DAO method uses it, but never return it."

6030875,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"In Java, is better maintain data in the ResultSet or transform to array?"
6030875,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"In the server class, is better I maintain the result of the query in the ResultSet and transforming in a array of objects when the client class make the request or transforming all in a array of objects and sending him partially when the request occur?"
6030875,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,I think that maintain in the ResultSet is more easier to do and control.
6030915,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,The biggest reason to not leave it in the ResultSet is that it doesn't release the connection back to the pool (unless I'm sorely mistaken).
6031084,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,If the ResultSet is only being used in a very restricted scope ( ie a single method ) then there's no real benefit in unloading it in to a different data structure though.

6189886,2,1,3,java.sql.ResultSet,"In particular you should consider writing Utilty-Classes for null-safe calling methods on Connection, Statement and ResultSet methods when you are dealing with plain JDBC."
6195962,2,1,4,java.sql.ResultSet,This would involve casting the ResultSet object into an OracleResultSet so that the inner elements of the collection can be accessed via instances of oracle.sql.ARRAY elements.
6195962,2,1,4,java.sql.ResultSet,"You could also read an Object from the ResultSet using the getObject method, and then cast it into the oracle.sql.ARRAY instance which represents the collection."

6203438,2,1,3,java.sql.ResultSet,You can use ResultSet.getDate('date') to retreive a Date object.
6212677,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,No ResultSet when using MS SQL Server 2008 R2 transactions in stored procs?
6212677,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,Most the stored procs are simple CRUD type ones (ie don't need to use transactions) and return some nice ResultSet objects into the Java code.
6212677,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,The issue is that when the Java code tries to call that using prepared statements and the execute method (which captures ResultSets just fine for all the other stored procs) there is no ResultSet coming back?
6224581,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,You can build a collection like a Map from the ResultSet.
6253609,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,Or at least write a SQL with an resulting ResultSet which is easy to evaluate in Java afterwards.
6264902,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Are you sure the resultset exhausted exception is on the rs ResultSet and not on the other two possible ResultSets : check and checkTarget ?
6265495,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"FYI, when you try to use multiple resultsets, Access automatically closes the first resultset before it creates the second, so you get the message:  ""ResultSet is closed"""

6348816,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,The standard way is to loop over the ResultSet once and (possibly) store each record in an array -which you can later loop over and over as you like.
6348816,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"The relevant  point is this: you'd (apparently) like to keep the ""raw"" records that a ResultSet returns in each next() call (so that you can store each record on an ArrayList and treat it as a scrollable ResultSet or sort of)."
6348816,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"The ResultSet belongs to the JDBC layer, which is a rather low-level layer, and which has its problems and pitfalls."
6348816,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"In general, the ResultSet should be consummed and closed as quickly as you can, and should not leak to upper layers."
6348562,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,But a more OO friendly way would be to create an object to represent what a row of data represents and create a List of these objects from the ResultSet.
6348562,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"To pull the data, just loop through the ResultSet like you have been then for each loop create a new instance of your custom object and add it to the list."

6358004,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"By default, only one ResultSet object   per Statement object can be open at   the same time."
6358004,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Therefore, if the   reading of one ResultSet object is   interleaved with the reading of   another, each must have been generated   by different Statement objects."
6358004,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,All   execution methods in the Statement   interface implicitly close a   statment's current ResultSet object if   an open one exists.
6367737,1,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,ResultSet: Exception: set type is TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY -- why?

9986193,2,1,4,java.sql.ResultSet,Building the ResultSet will most likely make a JDBC RPC call to the database and the authors of the JDBC specification wanted to discourage multiple round trips.
9986193,2,1,4,java.sql.ResultSet,Most ResultSet implementations also hold a connection to the database open so that when you get certain fields (such as large blobs) it can call back to the database to get the data.
9986193,2,1,4,java.sql.ResultSet,Having multiple connections open or (worse) using the same connection from multiple ResultSet objects would be very dangerous/confusing.

12346295,2,1,3,java.sql.ResultSet,"Here in your code , You are creating new ResultSet in the method getUser using the same Statement object which created result set in the usersInProject method which results in closing your resultset object in the method usersInProject."
12335560,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,However note that there are many situations in which a ResultSet will be automatically closed for you.

12402508,2,1,7,java.sql.ResultSet,PreparedStatement.close() and ResultSet.close() If you don't do this they are retained and become a form of a memory leak.

17161869,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,You need to convert the element from the ResultSet that you get as an answer into an object of AccountHolder and return that instead of the line return 1;.

17194984,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"I can't tell what how your TableModel works (it looks like you might be using the DefaultTableModel),  but I would suggest using Vectors instead of Arrays to get the data from your ResultSet."
17194984,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,I know the reason is because Arrays are 0 based and the ResultSet is 1 based.
17194383,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Edit: From the Oracle Docs:  The method isLast() cannot always detect when the ResultSet is   positioned on the last row and may return false instead of returning   true when used on a FORWARD-ONLY ResultSet.

17207233,2,1,4,java.sql.ResultSet,EDIT : In case if you need only period from the query: just have rs.getInt(1) and remove rs.getInt(2) to rs.getInt(12) Rule of thumb is : the number of column in the select clause and ResultSet.getXXX() should be same.
17213280,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,This method returns a ResultSet object.
17213280,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Assuming that you have a valid tableName and columnName in your database, the ResultSet object should ideally contain only 1 row."

17368992,2,0,3,java.sql.ResultSet,You can't do that until you've read the data - otherwise how is the ResultSet going to read it?
17368992,2,0,3,java.sql.ResultSet,"In particular, from the docuemntation for ResultSet.close:  Note: A ResultSet object is automatically closed by the Statement object that generated it when that Statement object is closed, re-executed, or is used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results."

17447293,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"So I am inserting the rows with the following method and apparently although I know the ResultSet consists of 50 rows, it is looping only for 13 times in the while loop and therefore when I go to extract some fields from this table, I do not have the required result."

17475105,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,Does it fetch the rows immediately after query execution (after the client application invokes PreparedStatement.executeQuery()) or after the client application first invokes ResultSet.next() to retrieve a row from the result set?
17475143,2,0,3,java.sql.ResultSet,This can be inconvenient for large data sets so the JDBC driver provides a means of basing a ResultSet on a database cursor and only fetching a small number of rows.
17491193,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"In the case where the statement has the default fetch size of zero, executeQuery() retrieves all rows from the server and ResultSet.next() retrieves and returns the next row from memory, not from the server."

17763974,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,the line ResultSet result = preStatement.executeQuery(); takes approximately 1 minutes to execute.
17776485,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"I think that there are two primary options here:  a. if you're interested in just one QuerySolution from a ResultSet and you're running these queries locally, then you can take the QuerySolution and use it as an initialBindings argument for the QueryExecution, and the values of the variables in the QuerySolution will be used in the second query."
17776485,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"This probably only works for local queries (since some the values in the ResultSet could be blank nodes whose values wouldn't make sense in a remote context), and it's only useful if you have a single QuerySolution of interest."
17776485,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,The more general solution uses SPARQL 1.1's VALUES to provide the content of the ResultSet in a VALUES block.
17776485,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"In the first case, the fact that Alice's address gets selected shows that the value of ?alice carried from the first ResultSet to the initialBindings."
17776485,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,Note that this will work even if the ResultSet binds multiple variables.

18052927,2,1,0,java.sql.ResultSet,For a selectable stored procedure the results are retrieved like a normal ResultSet.
18052927,2,1,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Normally for a selectable stored procedure you should use executeQuery() and process the ResultSet returned.
18052927,2,1,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"Due to an implementation artefact and compatibility with older versions of Firebird (where it was not possible to differentiate between selectable and executable procedures), it is possible to retrieve values of the first (or current) row of the ResultSet using the getXXX() methods of the CallableStatement as well."

18145934,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,In that I am using 12 Statement and ResultSet objects.
18166488,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"The problem is, you are closing the statement, which will automatically close the associated ResultSet: code."
18166488,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"From Statement#close() javadoc:  When a Statement object is closed, its current ResultSet object, if one exists, is also closed."
18166488,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"Having said that, you should never pass around your ResultSet object around your methods."
18166488,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"This way it would be very difficult to manage resources, as you would have to keep your Statement and ResultSet objects opened accross methods."

18166488,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"Also, you should close the resources like, ResultSet, Statement, and Connection in a finally block, so as to ensure they are always closed, even in case of exception."
18174776,2,0,3,java.sql.ResultSet,After the first while loop navigates across the ResultSet rs  the subsequent while loop is never entered as there as no more available records and rs.next() returns false code.
18174776,2,0,3,java.sql.ResultSet,This can then be passed directly to the JComboBox constructor after a single navigation of the ResultSet.
18178582,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Make sure you are not closing the ResultSet before you are trying to use it.
18178582,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,This can happen when you return a ResultSet and try to use it elsewhere.
18188733,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"You should use the ResultSet.getSQLXML() method to read the XML column value, then use an appropriate method of the SQLXML class, e.g."

18217157,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Use the new try-with-resources statement which would automatically close the ResultSet whether an exception occurs or not because it implements AutoCloseable.
18216922,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,You should close the ResultSet in the mainTest method to segregate populateRS method's participation in the lifecycle of the ResultSet.
18216922,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,You should have a finally block in which you should close the ResultSet.
18216922,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,This practice gives you a guarantee that the ResultSet is closed even if an exception is thrown.
18216928,2,1,3,java.sql.ResultSet,You should probably use a try-finally block to close the ResultSet even if populateRS (or something else) throws an exception: code.
18223605,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,I have a database column with 54 values.I want to create a table for each values.But my code only creates first value table then it shows an error due to closing ResultSet.
18223605,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,How can I reopen the ResultSet using a loop?
18223701,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"By default, only one ResultSet object per Statement object can be open   at the same time."
18223701,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"Therefore, if the reading of one ResultSet object is   interleaved with the reading of another, each must have been generated   by different Statement objects."
18223701,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,All execution methods in the Statement   interface implicitly close a statment's current ResultSet object if an   open one exists.
18256734,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,I'm writing some code that stores a Java ResultSet as AVRO data/schema.
18256734,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,The way I'm doing this is I take the ResultSet and I query its ColumnMetadata to generate the AVRO schema.
18256734,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,Then I take the data from the ResultSet and write it out as a TSV file so we have a human-readable version of the output for diagnostic purposes.
18256734,1,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"I've considered not writing the TSV file and instead just writing the AVRO file directly from what I see in the ResultSet, but I have a hunch I'm going to have the same problem since the DataFileWriter doesn't seem to like """" or null values for LONG fields."
18266150,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,stmt.executeQuery return a ResultSet object and from the object we can retrive the result of the query like below for your case.
18276833,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,I am wondering why getHoldability() method is not supported since setting ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT does not give problems at all.

18299252,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Closing the cursor of a ResultSet?
18299252,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,From this oracle java tutorial:    The following statement specifies that the cursor of the ResultSet   object generated from the getPrice query is closed when the commit   method is called.
18299252,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"Note that if your DBMs does not support   ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT, then this constant is ignored:  code."
18299252,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Does it mean that ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT closes the ResultSet?
18299252,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,It appears from the name that it just closes the cursore of the ResultSet.. what use would it be if that was the case?
18300252,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,From a JDBC programmer view:  You access the data in a ResultSet object through a cursor.
18300252,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,This cursor is a pointer that   points to one row of data in the ResultSet.
18300252,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,The method ResultSet.next moves the   cursor to the next row.
18300252,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,This method repeatedly calls the   ResultSet.next method with a while loop to iterate through all the   data in the ResultSet.
18300252,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,About Statement.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT  Statement.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT: The constant indicating that open   ResultSet objects with this holdability will be closed when the   current transaction is commited.
18300252,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"So yes, cursor will be (theoretically) closed; I wrote theoretically because   if your DBMs does not support ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT, then   this constant is ignored"
18299754,2,1,1,java.sql.ResultSet,Here's what the javadoc says:  The constant indicating that open ResultSet objects with this holdability will be closed when the current transaction is commited.
18317222,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"It's usually not the ExecuteQuery() call that takes very long, but the ResultSet.next() loop that runs for a long time, fetching all the rows."
18301326,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Can a ResultSet be 'null' in Java?
30849608,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"No, ResultSet returned by executeQuery(java.lang.String) method can never be null."
30849608,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"Moreover, the standard way to check whether a ResultSet is empty or not is to try setting its cursor to first row by using its first() and if it returns false it indicates that ResultSet is empty."
30849608,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"So, in your case you don't even need to check rather just return rs.first(); NOTE: however if you intend to process the ResultSet further you should move the cursor before first else you will skip the first row while traversing the ResultSet."
18301357,2,1,4,java.sql.ResultSet,It says:  Returns:   a ResultSet object that contains the data produced by the given query; never null   Emphasis mine.
18307178,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,Getting ResultSet is closed exception but i didn't close it in the code.
18307213,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"From the docs for ResultSet:  A ResultSet object is automatically closed when the Statement object that generated it is closed, re-executed, or used to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results."

28124905,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,Let's start from the documentation for ResultSet.
28124905,2,0,5,java.sql.ResultSet,It says:  A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that   moves forward only.

28125502,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"JavaDoc says: ""The constant indicating the type for a ResultSet object that is scrollable but generally not sensitive to changes to the data that underlies the ResultSet"" ."
28136774,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"As far as I could tell, the settings ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE and ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE did not actually affect the behaviour when retrieving data from MySQL."

28136774,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,Finally I came to the conclusion that the ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_[IN]SENSITIVE setting really doesn't make any difference under MySQL Connector/J.
28136774,2,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"While simply scrolling around the ResultSet it always seems to act like it is INSENSITIVE (ignoring any changes to existing rows that were made by other processes), but rs.refreshRow(); always returns the latest data (including changes made by other processes) as though it is SENSITIVE even if the ResultSet is supposed to be INSENSITIVE."

31947829,2,0,2,java.sql.ResultSet,The other approach is to NOT hard code the column names (if you build your query to only get specific columns) but instead get the column names from the meta data of the ResultSet.
31947812,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Is it possible to directly return the java.sql.ResultSet from Groovy?
31947812,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"I have a Groovy script that is using the groovy.sql.Sql class to communicate with the DB, but some legacy Java code is expecting to receive a java.sql.ResultSet."
31947812,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Is there any way to execute a SELECT query using groovy.sql.Sql and directly return the java.sql.ResultSet?
31949115,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"One of the main reasons to use Groovy's Sql is to automatically handle resources (which is why there are methods using closures to interact with the ResultSet, but none that return it -- to ensure they get closed)."
31949115,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,I'd strongly recommend revisiting why you are passing around references to ResultSet (which could be holding onto server resources) rather than using a POJO/POGO representing those results.
31949115,2,1,2,java.sql.ResultSet,"However, if you insist on using ResultSet, and you only need few convenience methods, I guess one option would be to copy those methods into your codebase."
31967936,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,Why is there an Operation not allowed after ResultSet closed in my code?
31967936,1,0,1,java.sql.ResultSet,"I am getting an ""Operation not allowed after ResultSet closed error"" for the below code block."
31987617,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Operation not allowed after ResultSet closed.
31987917,2,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,Note how the ResultSet is closed in a finally block to stop leaks.
32009228,2,1,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"In addition, you must call rslt.next() before accessing the ResultSet."
32014877,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"This method takes the database name and query, calls another method from different class which returns ResultSet from this query and database name(connection strings are stored in database), converts this ResultSet to DefaultTableModel and returns it."
32014877,1,0,0,java.sql.ResultSet,"Now if a network issue comes up, my class method which returns ResultSet throws IOException but all i see on the JOptionPane is error Cannot set a null Table model."
