Maybe the problem is just that there are so many possible choices of how Swing components can communicate with a controller, and none of them looking really ""right"" at the first glance..."
1070551,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"An Action is basically the same as an ActionListener, all you need to do is implement the actionPerformed() method."
1075251,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The way you are declaring the ActionListener you are making an instance of the anonymous inner class each time that method is called.

1083580,1,0,13,java.awt.event.ActionListener,They also had created an ItemHandler class that extended from the ActionListener class that conducted a linear search on the entire array of radio buttons in order to determine the one that was selected and changes the state of the program accordingly.
1083580,1,0,13,java.awt.event.ActionListener,This seemed rather inefficient to conduct a linear search of information so I had rewritten the ActionListener class to take in the proposed value to modify in the constructor and gave each radio button its own ActionListener with the proposed value passed in by the constructor in order to avoid doing a linear search.
1083596,2,0,15,java.awt.event.ActionListener,(Note: this is a simplification) Memory usage: Mostly an ActionListener has no state.
1090226,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,If you're developing a real application you're going to value the separation of concerns the second buys you (although I'd probably want to see the ActionListener stuff in a whole class of its own).
1090226,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I'd create a separate class that is an ActionListener and have that be a dedicated controller.

1224487,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You will need to add an ActionListener to your button and in the actionPerformed method you can write the code to display a result in your JTextArea: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html More info on buttons: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/components/button.html You can drag objects from a JList to another component (such as a JTextArea or JTable), but you would probably not drag them directly onto a JTabbedPane."
1225085,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The problem with this method tho is that when you need to bind a mouseListener or ActionListener to the TextField you will have a hard time figuring out which cell number it corrisponds to.
1225085,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Using this method you can also implement MouseListener or ActionListener on the extended class too and get whatever information about the field you need, without searching through your array."
1274029,1,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"OK, so if I add an ActionListener to a GUI element, and it's the only element I use that ActionListener with, does it matter which of the following lines (a,b) I use to get the checkbox selected state?"

1326677,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, I disagree with akf about ActionListener being the most standard approach - This may be true of smaller GUIs but not more complex Swing applications."
1325521,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"From the Action JavaDoc:  Note that Action implementations tend to be more expensive in terms of storage than a typical ActionListener, which does not offer the benefits of centralized control of functionality and broadcast of property changes."
1338977,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Example, to create a Button  you need the class java.awt.Button  but if you want that any action happen when you click the Button, you need a  java.awt.event.ActionListener  that will ""wait"" for the click,  then produce a java.awt.event.ActionEvent."

2986978,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Going to a more general type (like changing an ActionListener into an Object) is called upcasting, and is always safe, assuming the class you're casting to is one of the ancestors of your current class (and Object is an ancestor of everything in Java)."
2986978,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Going to a more specific type (like casting from ActionListener to MySpecialActionListener) only works if your object actually is an instance of the more specific type.
2986978,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So, in your case, it sounds like what you're trying to do is say that ConfirmFrame implements the interface ActionListener."
2986978,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The problem here is that Object doesn't have a method called actionPerformed; only a more specialized class (in this case, an implementation of ActionListener like your ConfirmFrame class) would have it."
2986978,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So what you probably want is for that constructor to take an ActionListener instead of an Object.
2986978,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Of course, more explanatory variable names than ""o"" or ""a"" would probably help you (and anyone else reading this) understand why you're passing an ActionListener into another ActionListener."

3144233,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You can add an ActionListener to this text field.
3144233,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In the ActionListener you could try invoking the transferFocus() method which should be equivalent to tabbing our of the text field.
7154501,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,There is a workaround… In a similar context (JTextField instead of JComboBox) the Sun/Oracle Java Tutorial provides the example InputVerificationDemo where a class is created that:  Extends InputVerifier (to handle tabbing/clicking where focus is about to be lost) Implements ActionListener (to handle pressing Enter key without leaving field)  The good thing about this workaround is that you can locate your handling code all in one place.
3149498,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,However if you are dealing with a JButton you probably want an ActionListener attached to the button.
3149498,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Then you use a ActionListener to start the process going when the button is pressed, and stop it when the button is released."
3154892,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"First your anonymous ActionListener simply forwards to a method called myButtonActionPerformed, so obviously the issue is not in the posted code, but rather in something that happens or is caused to happen inside myButtonActionPerformed."

5285609,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Perhaps you can call it addActionListenerToInput(ActionListener listener).
5286751,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Either that or define column and row variables within your ActionListener, not outside (otherwise you'll just end up always using the same values which will be the ones declared last in the loop.)"
5286778,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I think that you need to create your own class which implements ActionListener and has member variables to store the column and row values.
5286778,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"As written, all of the individual ActionListener objects will be reading the values from the same Column and Row variables and thus all will end up with the last values assigned to those variables"
5286791,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I guess m and n are declared as fields in the surrounding class (else the ActionListener could not access them, i.e. there would be a compiler error)."
5286791,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,That already hints at the solution: each ActionListener needs its own variables m and n. In code: code.
5319513,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Your ActionListener is accessing the class variable which is null.
5329369,2,0,13,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Looking for EventHandling, ActionListener?"
5331397,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You add the same ActionListener to all three buttons.

5335190,2,1,8,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You technically did implement ActionListener.
5335190,2,1,8,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You created an instance of an anonymous class, or a class that implements ActionListener without a name."
5335190,2,1,8,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"This way, your method can have a slightly more descriptive name than actionPerformed, and it also makes it usable elsewhere in your class besides the ActionListener."
5340136,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"addActionListener is expecting an implementation of an ActionListener, which is an interface."
5357391,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Also, to display the ""hello world"" screen you need to create ActionListener that displays it and add it to your button."
5364275,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The only time a panel gets added is in this ActionListener: code.
5364275,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"This is only getting called when ""Open"" is clicked as you have, I assume accidentally, added the ActionListener to the open JMenuItem rather than the newAlbum JMenuItem."
5366056,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, I also agree using a button is better than a label and then you would use an ActionListener instead of a MouseListener."
5366056,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Now if you use an ActionListener you can use the setActionCommand(...) method to store the index value of the button.
5366618,1,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I just want to add a JButton & ActionListener that will write the Class Name, GPA Points, and calculated GPA to a .txt file."
5376587,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Have it and itself as an ActionListener to the preceding box and whenever an item is selected it should enable/disable itself.
5381433,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"This way each button gets his own ActionListener, and you don't have to do this if (source == ...) comparisons."
5381097,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In your actionPerformed method you handle 3 different event source (cmdGood, cmdBad, cmdAverage), but you don't handle cmdExit, even though it uses the same ActionListener."
5381101,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,All actions have to be handled through the ActionListener interface.
5381101,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I strongly suggest that you have a separate ActionListener per button, rather than one for them all with a if/else loop inside."
5381119,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The problem is you don't give that button an ActionListener

5405031,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In order to be able to control your label's position you have to make use of three core operations:  container.setLayout(null); (for the container component holding your label label.addActionListener(myActionListener); to add the ActionListener to your label label.setLocation(newX, Y); to move your label component (needs to be performed in your actionPerformed-method)"
5451010,1,0,8,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Nested class vs implements ActionListener.
5451010,1,0,8,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Are there any benefits or drawbacks to creating a nested class that implements ActionListener: code.
5451010,1,0,8,java.awt.event.ActionListener,versus implementing ActionListener in the main class itself: code.
5451127,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Usually you want to use a nested or even anonymous class rather than exposing ActionListener to the API of the enclosing class.
5451127,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"(public class Foo implements ActionListener -> Javadoc will state that Foo is an ActionListener, though this is usually just an implementation detail -> bad)"

5500402,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In general, I would recommend to not use the getActionCommand() method, but to give each button an own ActionListener."
5500709,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You could use a JButton with an ActionListener to grab the input when the user clicks on the Button.
5521006,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Your ActionListener should be able to distinguish which one is selected by examining this.
5521030,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The ActionListener tells you which button was clicked in the ActionEvent: code.
5523396,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Once you has the names in the component you will have to add an ActionListener to capture the user's selection if you want something to automatically happen once they choose a name.
5524492,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For JComboBox, you'll have to use ActionListener."
5525310,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener is an interface and you cannot instantiate an interface like new ActionListener(); I think in your case you want code.
5525312,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"ActionListener is an interface not a class, and you can not instantiate interfaces."
5525952,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Firstly you need to import ActionListener and ActionEvent, by putting the following lines at the top of your class: code."

5535369,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,you will then need to implement ActionListener and override the actionPerformed method like so: code.
5535190,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You can also create a regular class that implements ActionListener interface and pass its object to addActionListener method.
5535299,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ImageIcon[] array and when clicking the button: label.setIcon(array[i]) in the actionPerformed method of the corresponding ActionListener.

5590357,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"When either of these are used, it is to trigger an ActionListener (no other listener is allowed)."
5590376,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For one you don't want to compare Strings with ==, for another, you don't declare Strings with single quotes, and for a third, the enter key is not obtained in this way, but rather by adding the appropriate ActionListener object to the JTextField itself, and finally there should be in a single ActionListener class that handles this action, so the if block is completely unnecessary."
5590376,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,This can probably be best done with a small inner private ActionListener class.
5590376,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You'd then create one object of this class and add it as an ActionListener for the querybutton and for the JTextField.
5590376,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The ActionListener is fired either by pressing the button or by pressing enter from within the JTextField.
5590376,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"edit 2: Having most handler or ""control"" code in its own Handler or Control class can be a good idea, but it doesn't have to implement ActionListener interface itself, but rather just have the code that will be called from within the ActionListener codes."

5605382,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Because ""CountingNumbers"" also implements the interface ActionListener, it is also an ActionListener, so that means it needs to have the same methods as defined in the ActionListener interface."
5605330,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Your class implements ActionListener, and while yes, it has an actionPerformed method, the method signature doesn't quite match that of the interface in that this method is supposed to have only one parameter, the ActionEvent parameter, and your method has 2, an ActionEvent parameter and a JFrame parameter."

6046815,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Then in the ActionListener you change the code to: code.
6131017,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"What I would do, I would actually create Model (Swing promotes MVC Design Pattern) that will hold data (different Locales) and I would set default Locale in correct ActionListener."
6131017,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You can use simple JLabels to do that, just set correct font properties and color and assign common ActionListener."
6053663,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I have the following code inside an ActionListener on the JButton ""support""."
6058723,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The sample code referenced ActionListener rather than the Action class directly.
6058723,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Typically when using Spring, you want to interact with the Interface (ActionListener) implemented by a Class rather than the Class itself (Action)."
6912579,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,and the NavigationMenu must implement the ActionListener inteface.
6062896,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I have an ActionListener set up on a JButton to fire off a series of tests.

6072866,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The problem lies at the bottom of the btnScanAction ActionListener when creating the Timer     timerDuration(durationMilliSec, timerDurationActionEvent).start(); its a problem with not being able to see the created Timer from within the ActionListener."
6072866,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Does anyone know of a possible way round this, still keeping the     timerDuration(durationMilliSec, timerDurationActionEvent).start();  In the ActionListener??"
6083973,2,1,7,java.awt.event.ActionListener,For instance if you displayed a JButton in the JOptionPane whose ActionListener caused the display of another JOptionPane.

6089878,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The problem is, that even if I write (being in the ActionListener class because the button invoked the calculation) to set the text of the JTextArea to something, it isn't shown while the calculation is done, and I can only see the end result, after the calculation is over."
6092571,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,How to add Swing components in an ActionListener?
6092571,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Here is my ActionListener: code.
6092571,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,But I can't add Swing components to the JFrame directly inside of an ActionListener.
6099622,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"My problem is that because durationTimer is created within an ActionListener, i cannot stop the timer from another ActionListener, as the program cannot ""see"" the variable name ""durationTimer""."
6099978,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You can declare the durationTimer at the class level and still construct it in the ActionListener.
6100466,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I don't know when btnScanAction is triggered (probably often since it is an ActionListener), but it creates a new timerDuration at each call."

6115435,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, when I run that same code from a JButton's ActionListener (during 'ActionPreformed()', the table does not update until the thread/event has finished."
6115466,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The ActionListener's actionPerformed is executed on the event dispatch thread and this will be blocked by your code inside.
6119547,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Add ActionListener to buttons then in actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){...} method you will have e.getSource() method to identify which has triggered this method means which button is pressed.
6126852,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"here ActionListener - is an interface, and by calling new ActionListener() {/*interfaces method implementations goes here*/}; you're creating anonymous inner class (anonymous because it have no name) - implementation of that interface."
6165432,2,1,12,java.awt.event.ActionListener,This will essentially toggle shouldDraw between true and false on every execution of the ActionListener which will make the cursor flash.
6167230,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"If the listener is an ActionListener, the Event I'm talking about will be the ActionEvent object that is passed into the listener's actionPerformed method."

6243377,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Make your JFrame implement ActionListener and call button.addActionListener(this).
6243377,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Then the code inside the actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) method will execute when the button is clicked :) Or you could make the ActionListener anonymous with code.
6243468,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The key is to check the state of the GUI in your button's ActionListener and then altering the behavior of this method depending on this GUI's state.
6243468,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"And you wanted the addButton to add the numbers in field1 and field2 together and place the results into the sumField, you're obviously not going to want to do any addition if either field is left blank, and so you test for it in the JButton's ActionListener: code."
6254966,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,For some reason every time I have someone run this program in Vista it works flawlessly but as soon as I move it over to a Windows 7 PC it stops in the middle of the ActionListener's Action Performed Method meaning I can click my choices but it will never say size selected.
6255320,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"If you wish to use swing, you must use some form of an AWT ActionListener."
6260831,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Addendum: The timer's ActionListener responds by invoking repaint(), which subsequently calls your overridden paintComponent() method code."
6268243,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,How do I access the source of an ActionEvent when the ActionListener is located in a different class?
6268243,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I've tried to adhere to the MVC pattern for the first time and now have difficulties accessing the source of an ActionEvent because the ActionListener is located in a different class.
6268375,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"That said, the direct answer to your question is: you shouldn't have to check inside your ActionListener implementation to see whether the appropriate object is the source of the event; you should simply only add the ActionListener to that one object."
6290045,2,0,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,but corerrect for SystemTray with TrayIcon would be add ActionListener for example code.
6306974,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The ""New Action"" Wizard in NetBeans 7.0 generates a class which implements the ActionListener interface and has several annotations."
6306974,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The missing piece here is that I have an ActionListener with some fance annotations, but instead I need an Action instance which is backed by this listener."
6306974,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"When trying to fill this gap I stumbled upon a blog post by Geertjan, which seems somehow related and led to an static method I added to my ActionListener: code."

6320375,2,0,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"It is not compiling because the actions listeners (like SellActionListener, for example) that you are providing (all bar the quit action) are not implementing ActionListener."
6320375,2,0,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The method addActionListener expects an object that implements ActionListener.
6320375,2,0,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I guess it would say something like ""class SellActionListener does not implement the interface ActionListener"" (or something along those lines)."
6321364,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"inside the anonymous inner class, you're calling that method on the ActionListener instance."
6322953,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In other words, if you're showing your other window from code called in a JButton's ActionListener, then there's no need to use SwingUtilities.invokeLater since the actionPerformed method will be called on the EDT."
6332835,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,DateTimer is also an ActionListener.
6344269,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,JFrame ActionListener.

27163288,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In my exmaple below the actual work starts from the EDT thread as it is from a button click ActionListener.
6800465,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Yes it can be done, but it doesn't really make sense, since your goal isn't to press a button or to call an ActionListener's code, but rather to have a common behavior on button press and on program start up."
6800465,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,To me the best way to achieve this is to have a method that is called by both the actionPerformed method of the ActionListener and by the class at start up.
6800465,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The method that causes this behavior is called both in the main class's constructor and in the JButton's ActionListener's actionPerformed method: code.
6800483,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"And then you can send them directly to the component with Component.processEvent(..) However, in this case I think you are better making your code into a separate function which is called both:  By the ActionListener when the button is pressed Directly by your application startup code (possibility using SwingUtilities.invokeLater() or SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait() if you need it to happen on the event-handling thread)  This way you don't mix up presentation logic with the business logic of whatever the code does...."

7650379,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You need to add some sort of ActionListener and detect when the user clicks a line on the screen.
7656377,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In this case the simple solution is to add an ActionListener to the text field instead of using Key Bindings.
7656377,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Of course this means you need to redesign your program to use a different ActionListener for each button.

8063865,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,an ActionListener: code.
8065627,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Register an ActionListener to the JButton instance and make sure you can access the toggle buttons therein to manipulate their state.
8069173,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The Graphics object you use in the ActionListener is already on the screen.
8072101,1,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,When I register ActionListener on a non-editable JComboBox it fires actionPerformed() every time user changes selected item with arrows keys or with context search (typing the first letter of the item name).
8072352,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"better would be implements ItemListener (fired twice SELECTED and DESELECTED), than ActionListener and KeyBindings, maybe with succes this simple example here  code."
8081816,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You are implementing ActionListener in the class of both components.
8081816,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You can do following to separate them:   1-Create a separate class and implement ActionListener interface in it and add it as a actionListener for one of the components.
8081660,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Obviously both components share an ActionListener.
8107913,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Have the console application instantiate the button ActionListener and pass it to the UI.
8107913,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The method in the ActionListener will tell it what to do.
8107955,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In that case it's will be visible in inner class ActionListener.
8107970,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Edit: Without changing the method signature you can redirect System.in to come from the String retrieved by the ActionListener: code.
8115606,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Add a Swing Timer/ActionListener set to go off 2 seconds after the main runs.
8135181,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I'm wondering that the compiler isn't complaining about your code: You are using a non-final local variable i within your anonymous inner ActionListener implementation.

8163754,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,How can I use new ActionListener() in addActionListener method?
8163840,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"addActionListener takes an ActionListener as an argument, so since you provide an actionPerformed method it assumes that the anonymous class you pass to it is an ActionListener."
8163840,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,It will not work anymore since the anonymous class you are passing does not implement the ActionListener Interface.
8163871,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,lets compare with the explicit class suppose you define the class which implement this ActionListener interface what you do?
8163871,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,this was the explicit implement and as you directly implement it's called Anonymous class as you defined here with ActionListener interface
8163876,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For example, because you have to add an ActionListener to a button, then associate it to action called in actionPerformed method, you have to declare in the first lines of your code: code."
8163876,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Where the keyword implements is needed to indicate you are implementing the abstract methods of the ActionListener interface, or any other interface, to use these methods with your objects."

8184449,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Looks like you want an ActionListener instead of a KeyListener.
8194924,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Edit Also, you know of course that you can get a reference to the JButton that stimulated the ActionListener by calling getSource() on the ActionEvent object passed into the actionPerformed method."

8276455,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The main part of your problem however appears to be that you aren't initializaing textTableNum before you try to add an ActionListener to it.
8288976,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In short though you need the following, public class TryItOut extends JFrame implements ActionListener,KeyListener{ and the in your constructor addActionListener(this); and addKeyListener(this); Do that and then try from there."

8347367,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The issue is that when I try to run the program, there is an error in the ActionListener that says that ""guessResult cannot be resolved""."
8349969,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The problem is that you never apply your ActionListener to the button.
8354892,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I also want to support a deactivation button in my GUI, but i can't see how the ActionListener for that button, which is defined in a MyServerFrame class, can ever be called and change the status of activated variable if the above server code is stuck waiting in accept."
8358481,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So the JButton with its ActionListeners is still alive (but just not shown) and in the second run you add another ActionListener to it, so of course, a second JFileChooser is created."
8360303,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I can't understand what an object of ActionListener represents though.
8360303,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Isn't ActionListener an interface?
8360501,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Note that ActionListener is an interface.
8360501,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You cannot instantiate interfaces.So this would fail:   ActionListener al = new ActionListener();  In OO parlance, you walk into a fruit shop and ask for a ""Fruit""."
8360501,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Now let's see this:  ActionListener al;  This is equivalent of saying Orange is a Fruit, which is a factual statement."
8360555,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,new is for creating object of the class (class without name) and then ActionListener means this class implements this Interface.
8360555,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So now you get simple an object of a class which has no name but provides you ability to override methods of ActionListener interface.
8360323,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,defines an anonymous class that implements the ActionListener interface.
8360323,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You are not creating an instance of ActionListener; you are creating an instance of this anonymous class.
8360323,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You can use this new object immediately in a function call (as with your first code snippet) or you can assign it to a variable that has a type that is assignment-compatible with ActionListener.
8364073,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"is an object of class URL so, everytime in a loop I find the new URL, and I call the function that has the 2 lines of code that I just posted above, in order to update the image on my label note that these 2 lines are inside a button ActionListener, so that everytime I click on the button, the next image will be displayed there is 1 major problem here."
8369222,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Works fine for me when using this code in the ActionListener.
8374120,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"To find out in the ActionListener which button was pressed, you could ask the ActionEvent for its source (see ActionEvent#getSource)."
8374720,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener doesn't do much but fire an action in the controller:  code.
8374720,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For example, if a button is clicked in the view, the ActionListener passes that information into the controller, which does some calculations, and passes back a command to update the view."
8383975,1,0,9,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Let ActionListener listen for change in JTextField instead of only enter?
8383975,1,0,9,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So as you may know, if you have a text field and you add an ActionListener to it, it will only listen to the keypress of the enter button."
8383975,1,0,9,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, I want to let my ActionListener listen to changes in text of the ."
8384552,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"you can add MouseListener (or MouseAdapter) to any JComponents, but you can't add ActionListener to the JComponents that didn't implements this method, otherwise Compiler or IDE returns Exceptions for example code."
8389815,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So if your main method must call such an ActionListener directly something might be wrong with your design.
8389815,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In the above example, the button will inform the ActionListener I added when it's pressed, and I can react on that by placing the relevant code in the actionPerformed method."
8406655,2,0,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For ""Cannot refer to a non-final variable mainGUI inside an inner class defined in a different method"" The error is because only member variables (of the enclosing type) or ""final"" local variables can be used from within an anonymous inner type (new ActionListener() { ... })."

8470028,2,1,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Instead create an ActionListener right there, where you need it."
8497024,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So you can move that method into the ActionListener for the button.
8504044,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Finally, you'd get your Submit button's ActionListener to generate the 'generic output XML' using e.g."
8514224,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,One of the features is that I am using a JButton with an ActionListener to open up a JFileChooser to select a file.

9569725,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"With more details, you can implement an ActionListener and then use the addActionListener method on your JButton."
9569725,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Here is a pretty basic tutorial on how to write an ActionListener.
9569988,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Here is trivial app showing how to declare and link button and ActionListener.
9569742,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You need to add an event handler (ActionListener in Java) to the JButton.
9575579,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Now make add an ActionListener (instead of an ItemListener) to your combo box: code.
9579134,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Perhaps I should be using a JPanel with ActionListener?
9590251,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,A simple solution would be to implement the ActionListener inline.
9591747,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Java add ActionListener to special button.
9594341,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,It's obvious I need some kind of loop inside the ActionListener class.
9594341,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener class: code.
9595567,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"To see the immediate effect of changing slider value, i mean updating it, use a button or some other component, add an ActionListener to it so that you can update slider value upon a click, for example."
9595607,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You need to call changeValue somehow:  I just added a JButton with an ActionListener to do this, and managed to make it work for me with the following code: code."
9599756,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I'm not sure I understand the question or the code, but I'd expect to see an ActionListener on the 3x3 button that would create an array of JRadioButton instances using a method that's something like this:  code."
9602026,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You can implement CRUD operator buttons in a similar fashion, getting use of ActionListener."
9606582,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Why use a MouseListener and not an ActionListener for JButtons?
9606582,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Why not add an ActionListener to all JButtons inside of the for loop?
9612205,2,1,9,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Also, when you assign an ActionListener to JTextField, the ActionListener will be called instead of the DefaultButton for the root pane."
9612205,2,1,9,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You must choose either to have an ActionListener or a DefaultButton, but you can't have both fire for the same JTextField."
9616700,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Add an ActionListener to the save button.
9622260,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Java Swing - ActionListener much slower than KeyListener.
9622260,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Adding something to the ArrayList now has an own JMenuItem with its accelerator set to the KeyStroke '1' and an ActionListener which performs the same stuff than the KeyListener before.
9625005,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Addendum: Instead of implementing ActionListener, implement Action by extending AbstractAction, which will make it easier to manage the accelerator key."
9623596,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You have to add an ActionListener to your Enter button.
9623596,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You either need to implement ActionListener or you can use an anonymous class: code.
9625791,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I have a class SaveFile implementing ActionListener.
9626293,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener not working Java.
9626293,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Why doesn't my ActionListener work here
9648312,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I normally check the value in the ActionListener.
9649620,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"""); so i know statements have change, loops has been performed and ActionListener/Itemlistener and so are working."
9649685,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Anyway, one of the shortest way to make your kill button work is adding an ActionListener to it and implementing what will happen when an action is performed on this button."
9658292,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Then check that the current displayed panel's data is valid in next and previous JButton's ActionListener.
9658910,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You'd have the JButton's ActionListener call:  code.
9662859,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"by default JWindow required JFrame for correct workaround nobody tell that this JFrame must be visible (valid for GUI), then remove these code lines from frame.setDefaultClose.... including frame.setVisible(true); from my example in this form current JVM instance never gone from RAM, untill your PC restarted or swith off, you have to add separated exit JButton with code line System.exit(0) inside ActionListener"
9671748,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"JFrame does not draw content, only shows white rectangle, when made visible inside ActionListener."
9675614,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"ActionListener is the one which is invoked when a button is clicked, and regardless of the way it's clicked (with the mouse, the keyboard, a keyboard shortcut)."
9672866,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"This is possible by writing a single ActionListener, and registering it with each button."
9680990,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In this way, you don't need to implement the ActionListener interface for your class, because you're implementing a inner istance of the interface for your pinButton."
9680724,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,If for example you were updating a text field from a ActionListener attached to a button then it would be unnecessary as you're already on the Event-Dispatch-Thread.
9689795,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"If you want to know when the user presses enter to send what they've typed, you can register an ActionListener on the JTextField."
9693531,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Java ActionListener class can't find variables.
9693531,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The problem is that home_b can't be found by the ActionListener class, regardless of what I do."
9694805,1,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So I've stumbled across several ways of implementing an ActionListener and I'm wondering if someone can walk me through the differences of how each works and whether there are reasons or advantages to use one over the other?
9694805,1,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The third was is simply having a separate class for the ActionListener, with similar code to that above, but within a separate class."
9694805,1,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I'm wondering whether the method approach is more efficient as new objects don't have to be created for each, you simply reference this as the ActionListener rather than, for example, referencing new myListener()."
9694837,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I don't like or use ""implements ActionListener""."
9694869,2,1,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,There's no difference in speed in any of the options; you'll always have an object that implements the ActionListener interface.
9694869,2,1,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For example, having your public class implement ActionListener may look weird for those who are using that class, especially if the ActionListener behavior is supposed to be private to the class and not used outside it."
9694900,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In some sense, there is only one way to create a listener: there must be an object of a class that implements ActionListener, which means the class has the actionPerformed method."
9694900,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,There are three ways to do this: You can modify a class you are already using for something else by marking it as implementing ActionListener and adding the actionPerformed method.
9700741,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You will want to add an ActionListener for the OK button.
9700741,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In the example, the ActionListener just closes the dialog."
9703960,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"First of, you need to add the ActionListener to the button so it will be called when the button is clicked."
9703960,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The other option is to have MasterGUI not implement ActionListener.
9703960,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Instead, make a unique ActionListener for each button that immediately know what action needs to occur when it was called."
9719523,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,i have tried ActionListener and ItemListener but it wont work and also i have tried searching for codes and method that might work on it but i just dont find it mostly might be because JCombobox is more popular i gees so .
9721423,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,First your class needs to implement the ActionListener Interface code.
9721203,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Buttons aren't magically able to do anything unless you give them code that lets them do things, and this is done by adding an ActionListener to the button."
9744383,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The main problem I'm having is calling the JTree from the one class through an ActionListener in the JMenuItem's class.
9745341,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Addendum: For reference, How to Use Actions offers a useful way to encapsulate the ActionListener."
9751805,2,1,7,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Simply use a javax.swing.Timer, and make one ActionListener, to do this thing for you ."
9764156,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Clear graphics from JPanel with ActionListener.
9778727,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You just need to add an ActionListener to your JMenuItem1 like this: code.
9778868,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For adding any actions into button, just make object from class that implement ActionListener interface: code."
9795611,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For instance, if a JButton is pressed, have its ActionListener inform the model (by calling the appropriate method), that the button has been pressed."
9795611,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"If the model needs information from the GUI, such as the text held in JTextFields, then the ActionListener will extract this text and then pass the information into the model using method parameters."
9804110,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener instances) and handle them.
9824391,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I see that you have an ActionListener added to the button, but that just means that someone is listing for actions."
9824391,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The code you show above doesn't define any actions on that newButton, so therefore there's no events being fired, and the ActionListener never gets notified of anything."
9827690,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Basically, if one ActionListener can't handle the event, it sends it to the next one, and so on."
30553006,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I wrapped the action listener in a method that would return an object that includes ActionListener using JRuby's :impl method code.
30553006,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,you could also create your own ActionListener class that includes ActionListener... code.
9839358,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Do I have to work with an ActionListener or AbstractAction?
9846118,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I am not sure why, but adding an ActionListener to the button that forces a redraw of the panel seems to help: code."
9847043,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Then in the button ActionListener write this code: code.
9853136,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Your problem seems to lie in the ActionListener.
9855260,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So the only thing that remains is to do this when the button is clicked, which can be achieved by adding an ActionListener to the button (JButton#addActionListener)."
9860815,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So, I need that my second jframe returns data into main jframe (using ActionListener for ""Save"" button), but I don't know how I can do it."
9862165,1,0,7,java.awt.event.ActionListener,JMenu ActionListener.
9862165,1,0,7,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I tried adding an ActionListener to it but it doesn't seem to recognize it.
9879321,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You need to write an ActionListener for your JButton.
9879321,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Take a look at the Java tutorials of How to write an ActionListener.
9882618,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I think the simplest solutions is to just check the model in the ActionListener.
9882845,1,0,31,java.awt.event.ActionListener,JCheckbox - ActionListener and ItemListener?
9882845,1,0,31,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Both ActionListener and ItemListener are used to fire an event with JCheckBox?
9883189,2,1,29,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Both ItemListener as well as ActionListener, in case of JCheckBox have the same behaviour."
9883189,2,1,29,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"As a coding practice do not register both ItemListener as well as ActionListener with the JCheckBox, in order to avoid inconsistency."
17576273,2,0,13,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Final words: An ItemEvent is fired even when the user deselects a check box by selecting another JCheckBox (when in a ButtonGroup), however ActionEvent is not generated like that instead ActionEvent only listens whether an action is performed on the JCheckBox (to which the ActionListener is registered only) or not."

9900304,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Each time you create a new ColourGrid object, you add the very same color buttons into the new ColourGrid JFrame and re-add an ActionListener to the same buttons."
9900304,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So each time this occurs, the JButtons accumulate another ActionListener, and pretty soon whenever a color button is pressed, many ActionListeners fire, both old and new, and all the buttons change color."
9900304,2,0,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"This way, each time you create a new ColourGrid object, it gets fresh new JButtons with only one ActionListener attached to each, and only the most recent grid button's color changes."

9959603,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,For instance your current GUI looks like this on my screen:   For example this ActionListener will show which button was pressed and will inactivate that button: code.
9970709,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Now, I can update the label when I type something into a JTextField and there is an ActionListener on that..."

13484094,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, I don't understand why this is the case because of the following :  addActionListener asks for an ActionListener as an argument ""btn"" is of type JRadioButton JRadioButton is NOT of type ActionListener JRadioButton DOES NOT implement ActionListener ( nor do the parent classes )  Can someone clear up the fact that addActionListener accepts this argument which to me seems to be of the wrong type ?"
13484094,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Note : I understand that the Window class in this example does implement ActionListener, but I don't see how this interacts with the type of the btn variable and the type requested by addActionListener."
13520574,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"As the class Window implements ActionListener, so its implementation of actionPerformed can serve as the concrete implementation for the JRadioButton component providing interaction between the 2 classes."
13486106,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The other problem you have is the local definition of times within your ActionListener.
13487965,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You have to use FrameTest.this here, as you're inside of an anonymous class implementing ActionListener, so the normal this would reference to that anonymous class."
13503829,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Timers are constructed by specifying both a delay parameter and an ActionListener.
13503829,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"(source) Futhermore, the timer's timing is done in thread distinct from the event dispatch thread (or EDT) which is the thread that runs the code in the ActionListener."
13506651,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You then don't need implements ActionListener for your main class.
13518356,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Basically just adds ActionListener to JComboBox the ActionListener is called whenever an item is selected or added.

13526555,1,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,What are the practical and philosophical differences between using an ActionListener vs. using a MouseListener on the JButton ?
13526600,2,1,6,java.awt.event.ActionListener,An ActionListener is used to handle the logical click of a button.
13526612,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,If you just want to know that the button has been pressed use ActionListener.
13526621,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"ActionListener is for picking up ""someone actioning the button""."
13526621,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So if you're really interested in the buton being activated use ActionListener.
13531549,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"use JTable instead of bunch of JTextField layed by GridLayout  or  add there putClientProperty and to add identifier Row a Column from GridLayout put JTextField to the HashMap I would be preferring putClientProperty (you can to multiplay number or additional infos.., number of separate putClientProperty isn't somehow reduced) depends of (not clear) desing, you can to add ActionListener to JTextField (accelerator is ENTER key) or DocumentListener  virtual example, code example for JButton and ActionListener, putClientProperty is accesible from all methods or Listeners added to JTextField  in the loop code."

13537403,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Each instance is completely distinct from the other, and so adding an ActionListener to one will have no effect on the other one (the displayed one)."
13540535,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I have tried to register recursively all the children of the parent figure to MouseMotionListener events, and although it ""solved my issue"" ('exitAction' was fired but I manage to caught it in the button's 'enterAction' and handled it) - another issue occurred: The button's 'actionPerformed' event (I have added the button an ActionListener) is not fired (or it is, but handled somewhere I cannot find...)."
13541952,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I think you're looking for an ActionListener instead of a MouseListener.
13541952,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,They have a class that extends ActionListener and implements the actionPerformed method.
13541952,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,To tell which button gets clicked within the actionPerformed method you would call the getSource method on the ActionEvent object like so: if(e.getSource() == button) If you need more explanation on having the class extend ActionListener let me know.
13543159,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I have tried using this code in Java, where I used a JFrame as it's own ActionListener."
13543374,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In your example you can use a JFrame instead of extending it Having a class which implements the ActionListener interface suggests to users of your API/code that it can be used as an ActionListener.
13543374,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, your class is not designed as an ActionListener."
13543374,2,1,5,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So use an ActionListener (anonymous class, inner class, ... ) instead of implementing it directly (or even better, use an Action)  And no, implementing the ActionListener interface directly has nothing to do with I saw that the GUI took a long time to load And as a side-note."
13543377,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Why would you want to implement the ActionListener on the class if it is used for a single button only?
13549009,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,and then in your ActionListener code.

13564630,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"not possible to add ActionListener, only MouseListener can do that, but not correct way for JButton depends of your code, you have to add ActionListener to every JButtons and to determinte which one is pressed by   put/getClientProperty ActionCommand programatically loop instide arrays of JButtons and to compare event and JButton"
13566878,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Note that if you only want to trigger the action when the button gets selected, it is easier to attach an ActionListener to the radio button."
13572680,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I think you need to use javax.swing.Timer instead of java.util.Timer [I suspect this because you are using ActionListener]
13575586,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,An ActionListener won't work if your desire is to listen for change in selected tab since this is activated only by the children of the AbstractButton class.
13575586,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"If on the other hand you're wondering if you can use a JButton/ActionListener within one component held by a tab and have the actions cause changes in another component held on another tab, then the answer is certainly, even if the two views are created by different classes."

13675239,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, when paint is placed within the ActionListener, my compiler throws errors, and eclipse does not recognize paint as a method at all, despite importing java.awt.geom."
13675258,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You could place a single repaint() call in your ActionListener method to request that a repaint be carried out.
13691195,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,What is the difference between an ActionListener and an EventListener in Java?
13691262,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The interface ActionListener is a subinterface of EventListener.
13691262,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In practice, it is probably better to implement the most specific interface you can, such as ActionListener or WindowListener."
13691308,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The ActionListener interface is utilized for treating action events.
13707884,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"As your example says button, you can implement ActionListener to your Frame object, then actionPerformed() function calls your function."

13714119,1,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I'm trying to use a separate class from the first to act as the ActionListener and display the name that was typed in.
13714119,1,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,And this is the ActionListener class: code.
13714206,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You are passing in an empty String into the ActionListener class SubmitButton  when it is created and it is never updated once the text changes in the JTextField textBoxToEnterName so nothing is ever displayed.
13716497,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"It makes no sense to place this windowEvent method in an ActionListener, since that is part of a WindowListener, something completely different."
13719314,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Correct me if I'm wrong, you just need a skeleton of an ActionListener?"
13743652,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,And here's my ActionListener: code.
13746619,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So, in your ActionListener, you need to iterate again over all your JTextFields."
13746619,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Now, in your ActionListener, clear kundeOrdreArrayList and add the values from all the JTextFields again: code."
13749770,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"JButton.addActionListener(ActionListener act) needs a parameter of the type ActionListener, actionPerformed is a method collection, which is not the right type."
13749770,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"this is the current object, which is of the types  DrawTicTacToe, GUIcolletion and ActionListener (and probably some more, depending on what the superclasses of these are)."

14918012,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The solution is as I've stated in a comment above, to do your parsing in an event listener such as an ActionListener."
14918012,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,This means that the parsing will take place when the user triggers an event such as pressing a JButton that triggers an ActionListener or when clicking on a JLabel and thereby triggering a MouseListener.
14923299,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Move your statements inside your ActionListener rather than having them in the constructor: code.

14940440,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,That's the role of the ActionListener.
14944310,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Lets take the ActionListener interface for example.
14944503,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The JButton calls the ActionListener.
14944503,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"When it receives a mouse click or a keypress which means ""click the button"", it creates an ActionEvent instance, loops through all the ActionListener instances that have been added to itself, and calls each one with the ActionEvent as argument."
14948962,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"What I basically want to do is to call the new GameList().start() method from an ActionListener of homepage as I can call from main method, display the GameList and hide the homepage."

19305391,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The action command is only for the ActionListener (in which case you would use the getActionCommand() method of the ActionEvent) and not a KeyListener.
19311212,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Let's replace it with a new ActionListener class, RandomCreatureListener."
19317822,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener on JFileChooser inside a JTabbedPane.
19317822,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I have an ActionListener and have tried a few things, but it seems that the code I am using is not firing as it won't even print to the console."
19317950,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The JFileChooser class has an addActionListener(...) method that will accept your ActionListener above.
19317950,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You never tell us if or how you are adding the ActionListener above to the JFileChooser, but if you are in fact doing this and your code still isn't working, then you'll want to create and post an sscce for us to test and fix."
19317950,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Edit Also, I would create the ActionListener to be used with the JFileChooser only and would thus get rid of this line: code."
19321426,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,If so then make next two changes: First: Implement ActionListener interface in your Stock class code.
19340492,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,( concept of ActionListener).
19340492,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So here's some code for an ActionListener: code.
19340519,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The timer thus executes your ActionListener every five seconds.
19341240,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"However, someone explain: ""this"" represents an implemented and instantiated ActionListener, which happens to be your class."
19341329,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"In your case, ""this"" is both ""a reference to the current object"" and ""an implementation that implements the ActionListener interface""."
19341329,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"It means that the enclosing class (""this"" stands by) should implement the interface ActionListener."
19341329,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"You can refer to below code to get the idea: ""this"" stands for an instance of YourClass which implements the ActionListener code."
19341437,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In the example below SomeClass implements ActionListener interface which has only one method (actionPerformed which takes an ActionEvent object as an argument) that needs to be implemented.
19341278,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The ActionListener is then going to wonder where it is going to get the listener code, and you are stating that you want it to be called from ""instanceofMyClass"", which could be swapped with ""this"" You could find another explanation with code here: What is the meaning of ""this"" in Java?"
19349174,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For instance, if you want to paint multiple Rectangles, create an ArrayList<Rectangle> add to it in your ActionListener, call repaint() and have the paintComponent(...) method iterate through the List, drawing rectangles held by it."
19360179,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Well, you didn't even added ActionListener for your button and make actionPerformed method as non-static (just remove static)."
19360179,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Also, I recommend to use anonymous inner classes instead of implementing ActionListener directly to your class."
19366171,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"from ActionListener invoked from ENTER Key   both a.m. ways added to JTextField    then there are another two very important options  filtering in whole JTables, columns and rows (your code talking about ???)"
19365392,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"--- EDIT --- This is outside the scope of the original question, but well... To make your application create a report as you seem to want from the comments, these are the basic steps: 1 Write an ActionListener to respond to button clicks."
19365392,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,3 Wire your ActionListener to query the DB as desired and put the results into your data source.
19389748,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Use an ActionListener instead.
19390591,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"If the behavior will be the same for all your buttons, then implement a single ActionListener as follows: code."
19391298,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I have a simple requirement in my code: I need to get a selected item to realize a ActionListener that is enable a JButton.
19391298,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I want to implement an ActionListener that get the item selected and so enable a jbutton(""Comprar""), but I don't have any idea at this moment to do it."
19408389,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"ActionListener is interface,so you can let ""main"" class implement this interface and pass it to Window class as parameter in Windows class constructor."
19416103,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The button's Action or ActionListener must call the JOptionPane's setValue method: code.
19416446,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I'm making a cookie clicker clone in java to practice my java skills and I have a small problem, I have variables that are declared in the main method that I want to access from an ActionListener class."
19416446,1,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Here is some sample code from the ActionListener class.
19416811,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I'm making a cookie clicker clone in java to practice my java skills and I have a small problem, I have variables that are declared in the main class that I want to access from an ActionListener class."
19416811,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Here is some sample code from the ActionListener class.
19422006,1,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,How can I add an ActionListener to my JFileChooser that fires when the user clicks OK. And can I pass the selected file path as argument in the listener as well?
19425593,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I recommend: ""How to Use File Choosers"" JFileCooser showOpenDialog method pops up an Open File file chooser dialog and returns value of the state of the file chooser on popdown:  JFileChooser.CANCEL_OPTION JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION JFileCHooser.ERROR_OPTION  So this is the code for your ActionListener that will open File Chooser and react on demand: code."
19425339,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The example implements several listeners, including ActionListener."
19425631,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The timer fires an action event, which is handled by the ActionListener class."
19427498,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Q.2 Even if i added JCheckBox  to Panel and then adding that Panel to JScrollPane how do i manage there setSelected functionality i mean how i can add the ActionListener to that dynamically added JCheckBox?
19427912,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Go through the list adding ActionListener or you can get the main panel's children components, iterate through them casting to JCheckBox and add the listener."
19428590,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,As for Q2 you can store added checkboxes in a Vector or HashMap ( depends what logic is involved ) and then you can create custom ActionListener that implements mentioned interface.
19428590,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,What is more that  you can pass reference of your panel to your custom ActionListener and within it's actionPerformed use that reference to call methods on the panel which stores vector of your checkboxes.
19433016,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Later in your ActionListener you change x's value to 1: code.
19434850,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"So I tried to type cast it to a Notification object, but eclipse give me an error stating Cannot cast from new ActionListener(){} to Notification."
19435146,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Now you can use this ActionListener in any GUI because you haven't hardcode the class name as part of the code.
19434891,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Just using this refers to the ActionListener.
19445467,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Also you should store variables (like time_left) in model, not in the controller (i.e. ActionListener)."
19445467,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ViewControlListener.java - implements ActionListener code.
19445467,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Also my ActionListener (ViewControlListener.java) holds instances of model and view, so it can update variables in model and refresh view."
19441016,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"It does not implement ActionListener so it can't be used as parameter to JButton The static modifier on the Menu method means you can even use this anyway public static void Main is not a constructor, so beware @Override should appear before the method declaration, not in it."
19448268,2,0,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Well create a ActionListener subclass by implementing it with overriding the actionPerformed method, and then create an instance of it,  add the same instance to every jButton objects of your use-case."
19448274,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Just implement ActionListener in your class: code.
19448274,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,And then attach ActionListener to your buttons: code.
19448287,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Some tips :  use a switch instead of multiple if  use an ActionListener instead of MouseListener inside the listener, access to the clicked button with ActionEvent#getSource() create only one ActionListener and add it to all your buttons  Hope it help :)"
19449598,2,0,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Inside your ActionListener you can ask who's the source of the action event and then set the text field's text as needed: code.
19455138,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Zoom an Image after ActionListener.
19455446,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Your ActionListener will update the variable then call repaint() on the panel.
19458904,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You cannot call any frame's method because your ActionListener has its scope limited to Login panel.
19458904,2,1,3,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Implementing an ActionListener that has visibility  enough to dispose the frame.
19460298,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In Class1 just create an ActionListener for the button which calls the public method of Class2 with the value of JTextField as argument.
19461936,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"and on this JPanel I have a JButton, on pressing i want some operations to happen which i have written in it's ActionListener and in the end i have to dispose that JDialog, but i have no clue how to do it !!"
19468622,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Aside from not having start() function java.util.Timer doesn't have this type of constructor: new Timer(1000, tc) where java.swing.Timer has:  Timer(int delay, ActionListener litener) Your instance creation style of the Timer in actionPerformed() function is also wrong."
19471365,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener doesn't trigger event.
19475705,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The idea would be to attach an ActionListener to the first combo box, when it's actionPerformed method is triggered, you would load the values you need from the database into a new ComboBoxModel and apply it to the second combo box."
19494743,2,1,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,For instance if you set an ActionListener to a JTextField when you press Enter key it will dispatch an ActionEvent.
19480051,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Then you'd add the ActionListener class as the key listener.
19482244,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,It won't let me run the program due to the error: The type BingoHelper must implement the inherited abstract method ActionListener.actionPerformed(ActionEvent) code.
19482738,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,or remove the ActionListener interface from BingoHelper and implement the actionPerformed method of the AbstractAction code.
19492332,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,How do I implement an ActionListener with custom constructor?
19492360,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"ActionListener is an interface, there is no constructor in it."
19493549,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I'd start testing the time of response for this method in a separate test case Anyway I'd suggest you a few tips: 1) Note there's no need to implement an ActionListener to do your code.
19499341,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"a shared ActionListener)  (Another way of saying this: If you need polymorphism, your singleton must be an object and not a class)"
19500104,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"two JFrames, JFrame Main; // Main JFrame JFrame Sub; //Second JFrame that is initialized from within Main via a JMenuItems ActionListener."
19500322,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You state:  JFrame Sub; //Second JFrame that is initialized from within Main via a JMenuItems ActionListener.
19503349,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,And in my ActionListener for example this (but I think its not good) So when Creating a new person the JComboBox should autorefresh everytime.
19507611,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Add numeric values to a variable in ActionListener, to show variable result."
19507611,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"int R=0; Inside ActionListener of a button, I use set.Visible(); to move to next question (JPanel), and R=R+numeric value."
19515900,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Sounds like you want to create an ActionListener for your button, and set the visibility of the JDialog to true when you press the button."
19516772,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Everytime I select another item I want to get the selectedPerson to work with in that view for example I want to do this in my ActionListener that is in my view.
19522792,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,ActionListener code.
19524361,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Note that an ActionListener will only get invoked by the button at which it was registered.
19524247,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The grid variable is an instance variable so you can access it directly in your ActionListener.
19524247,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,So the code in your ActionListener would be a loop that iterates through both dimensions of your array and then sets the background of each button code.
19524247,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Also, you should not be creating a separate ActionListener for each button."
19527842,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You need to replace in you ActionListener following code: code.
19527842,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,The code is cleaner and you don't have to maintain two places ( one if(ltor) and second if(rtol) ) in your ActionListener.
19532554,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I'm modifying some existing Java code for an assignment and I can't figure out how to call a function of an existing object from within an ActionListener.
19532624,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I have supplied an ActionListener but it gets called only on selection and not on unselection.
19532759,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Don't use an ActionListener to check when the button is selected.
19539458,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I tryed the way oracle says:   Declare an event handler class and specify that the class either implements an ActionListener interface or extends a class that implements an ActionListener interface.
19539458,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,For example:  public class MyClass implements ActionListener { Register an instance of the event handler class as a listener on one or more components.
19542313,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Your class doesn't seem to be implmeneting ActionListener, therefore the action on your button will not be triggered."
19542313,2,1,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Alternatively, you can use an anonymous class to implement the code for your button, instead of making your class implement the ActionListener."
19550501,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,In the ActionListener for the confirm button the Scanner instance input in this statement blocks waiting on input from the user  code.
19550919,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,here is the ActionListener code.
19551637,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Your example does not work because ActionListener is an interface and you can't instantiate it.
19551637,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Instead you need to create your class which will implement it ( or add implements ActionListener to your class main and then implement actionPerformed ) And even if you have that right your program will finish earlier than first event will come so the actionPerformed will not be called.
19551446,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"ActionListener is an interface, not a class which means that you must implement the method(s) as shown below: code."

19552923,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Again, this should be in the ActionListener and should be a one shot deal, not called in a loop, but only when the listener is performed."
19552923,2,1,4,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"For example, the ActionListener could be as simple as: code."
19554598,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"I can't really speak to how ""common"" it is, and I don't know that you're risking world destruction by doing it, but if I needed something like this, I'd prefer to bite the bullet and write a full-fledged inner class (instead of the anonymous variety) to implement the ActionListener."
19554643,2,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"It is actually a common practice, but you can make it cleaner by introducing the actual class that implements ActionListener and provides the value through a getter."
19556144,2,1,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"The ""button"" panel's controller detects this event (probably via an ActionListener), it process this action and updates the model."

19612120,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,I'd like to have multiple ActionListener's in my class.
19612120,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,All these buttons do the same thing so I decided to use an ActionListener instead of having to write out 10 if statements per button.
19612120,1,0,0,java.awt.event.ActionListener,Is there any possible way to have more than one ActionListener in the same class?
19619751,2,0,1,java.awt.event.ActionListener,You can do an Inner Class: button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){ */Code goes here*/ } }) (save the actionListener in a variable and set it for many buttons) Do this multiple times for different buttons and you have multipleActionListeners.
19615304,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"Firstly, I wouldn't use a KeyListener to monitor changes to a text field, a DocumentListener would provide more useful information to the changes of the underlying field, but an ActionListener would probably be more appropriate under these conditions."

You Could Use an ActionListener on each field to detect when the user presses Enter (or the individual fields are actioned) and validate the state of each field to determine if you have enough information to perform the required calculations, but this doesn't take into account the case where the user doesn't press Enter on the field You Could Do both, use a FocusListener and ActionListener which simply calls a method that validates the state of each field to determine if you have enough information to perform the required calculations You Could Have a JButton that the user is required to press in order to perform the calculations."
21471343,2,0,2,java.awt.event.ActionListener,"While you could declare them as final and you'd be able to access them from within the inner class of the ActionListener, personally, I would declare them as instance variables, so that you could access them from anywhere within the class itself."
