157084,2,0,2,java.io.IOException,Detail: I am aware that the above code swallows any exception from the try block when the close operation in the finally block produces an IOException.
157084,2,0,2,java.io.IOException,"I don't think that is a big problem: generally, the exception from the try block will be the same IOException that causes the close to fail (i.e. it is quite rare for IO to work fine and then fail at the point of closing)."

534730,2,0,14,java.io.IOException,"Okay, abort the operation but don't necessarily shut down the whole process... You shouldn't have them that way round, admittedly - the FileNotFoundException would be masked by the IOException which it derives from."
534732,2,0,3,java.io.IOException,"Jon is right, the catch that catches the IOException will catch all IOExceptions and any sub-type of IOException, and since FileNotFoundException is a type of IOException, it will never hit the 2nd catch."
534769,2,0,5,java.io.IOException,"The order that you show, with IOException caught before FileNotFoundException is wrong."
534769,2,0,5,java.io.IOException,"Since FileNotFoundException extends IOException, when a FileNotFoundException is thrown, the first handler will be used, and the second handler is dead code."

571952,2,0,2,java.io.IOException,Close theoretically throwing IOException seems an abuse of checked exceptions because there's nothing you can expect the caller to do in response.
571976,2,0,5,java.io.IOException,To ensure that the file is deleted do as Eddie suggests and put the delete in a finnaly block - but you will also need to ensure that the raf.close() IOException is handled... something like: code.

20231597,2,0,19,java.io.IOException,"Imagine you currently catch any IOException thrown by write calls on an OutputStream, but you want to change the variable's declared type to a ByteArrayOutputStream, the compiler will berate you for trying to catch a checked exception that it says cannot be thrown."
614330,2,0,115,java.io.IOException,Why is IOException not a RuntimeException?
614330,2,0,115,java.io.IOException,"Maybe two methods up from the example you want to catch all IOExceptions from the whole writing-to-stream process, abort the process and jump into the error reporting code; in Java you can't do that without adding ‘throws IOException’ at every call level, even levels that themselves do no IO."
614122,2,0,33,java.io.IOException,"The secondary file is optional, so you can ignore its errors, but because the signature throws IOException, it's easy to overlook this)."

2624145,1,0,15,java.io.IOException,I think that class IOException should have been an unchecked exception because there is little that an application can do to resolve problems like file system errors.
2624145,1,0,15,java.io.IOException,"If so, then it is reasonable for IOException to be checked, but if it is not the case, then IOException should be unchecked so that business logic can delegate handling of this exception to a separate system error handler."

14904876,2,0,1,java.io.IOException,"If the load-document routine isn't prepared to sensibly handle the possibility that the load-translation-tables routine might fail, such failure shouldn't percolate up the same way as would an IOException that occurred while actually loading the document."
14904876,2,0,1,java.io.IOException,"The proper remedy would not be for IOException to be an unchecked exception, but rather for there to be a declarative means by which code could indicate that one or more kinds of checked exceptions should not be allowed to percolate out of a certain block from methods called thereby, but should instead be wrapped in some other exception type (e.g."
2624237,2,1,13,java.io.IOException,"Conversely IOException and its derivatives are exceptions that could reasonably occur during normal execution of a program, and common logic would dictate that either those problems should be dealt with, or at least the programmer should be aware that they can occur."

23127020,1,0,4,java.io.IOException,I know that it extends Reader class in which method read throw IOException but I think that it is not needed for StringReader.
23127020,1,0,4,java.io.IOException,After short investigation I found out that StringReader#read throws IOException if string which this class reads is null but de facto this can't happen because if we would try to pass null to StringReader constructor it throws NPE.
23127323,2,1,1,java.io.IOException,It calls ensureOpen() method that is actually throwing IOException because ensureOpen() checks to make sure that the stream has not been closed.
23127717,2,0,1,java.io.IOException,Even in the MyReader do not expose the IOException you still have to use try block.
23127717,2,0,1,java.io.IOException,The reason why StringBuilder throws IOException is not that it implement the interface Readable.
23127717,2,0,1,java.io.IOException,The reason of that is validation of the input in method ensureOpen() that throw an IOException when input is null.
23127717,2,0,1,java.io.IOException,The expected is that after you call close you can no longer read from it and you will get IOException.
23127257,2,0,3,java.io.IOException,"The IOException is required for all the implementations imaginable, including file sources and streams and sockets etc."
23127257,2,0,3,java.io.IOException,UPDATE: I have found the reason why the method read() must throw an IOException: because of the contract defined for the close() method.
23127257,2,0,3,java.io.IOException,"Once the stream has been closed, further read(), ready(), mark(), or reset() invocations will throw an IOException."
